Atrial fibrillation,"Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Lightheadedness.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
 
 symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional 
 need treatment.
 The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.
 This type of 
 is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.
 In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.
The two upper chambers are called the atria.
The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect.
A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome.
A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea.
Heart attack.
Heart valve disease.
High blood pressure.
Lung diseases, including pneumonia.
Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease.
Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid.
Infections from viruses.
Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine.
Illegal drug use.
Smoking or using tobacco.
Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription.
 The risk of 
 increases as you grow older.
 Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs — such as amphetamines and cocaine — can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.
 Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.
 Minerals in the blood called electrolytes — such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium — help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.
 An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.
 Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of 
. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.
 Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.
 People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
 You may be more likely to get 
 if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.
 Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.
 Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.
High blood pressure.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Some types of heart valve disease.
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.

Dry macular degeneration,"Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
 This disease is most common in people over 60.
 This disease has a hereditary component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
 Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
 Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.
 Research indicates that being obese may increase your chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more severe form of the disease.
 If you have heart or blood vessel disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.
 For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.
 Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.
 If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
 These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
 Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.
"
Albinism,"Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).

An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness — vision less than 20/200 — or complete blindness.
 the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene — one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance.

 causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
 is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than

Wet macular degeneration,"Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
You notice changes in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
 Sometimes irregular new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula. This is known as choroidal neovascularization. The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye, called the sclera. These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina's function.
 When fluid leaks from the choroid, it can collect between the thin cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina or within the layers of the retina. This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion.
 This disease is most common in people over 55.
 This disease has a genetic component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
 Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
 Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.
 Research indicates that being obese increases the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to a more severe form of the disease.
 If you have diseases that affect your heart and blood vessels, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.
 For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.
 Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.
 If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.

"
Myelofibrosis,"Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia
Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen
Easy bruising
Easy bleeding
Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats)
Fever
Bone pain
 Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50.
 A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.
 Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene.
 People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.
 Normally, blood flow from the spleen enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can lead to high blood pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). This in turn can force excess blood into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, potentially causing these veins to rupture and bleed.
 A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain.
 Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis) may create clumps (tumors) of developing blood cells in other areas of your body. These tumors may cause problems such as bleeding in your gastrointestinal system, coughing or spitting up of blood, compression of your spinal cord, or seizures.
 As the disease progresses, your platelet count tends to drop below normal (thrombocytopenia) and platelet function becomes impaired. An insufficient number of platelets can lead to easy bleeding — an issue that you and your doctor will want to discuss if you're contemplating any type of surgical procedure.
 Some people with myelofibrosis eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly.
"
Alcohol poisoning,"Confusion.
Vomiting.
Seizures.
Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute.
Breathing that's not regular. This is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths.
Skin that looks blue, gray or pale.
Low body temperature, also known as hypothermia.
Trouble staying conscious or awake.
 or your local emergency number right away. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning.
 If you know the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when, tell hospital or emergency staff.
 Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may vomit and choke and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because that could cause choking.
 Try to keep the person sitting up. If the person must lie down, turn the head to the side to help prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake.
Isopropyl alcohol, which is found in rubbing alcohol, lotions and some cleaning products.
Methanol or ethylene glycol, which is a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents.
 12 fluid ounces (360 milliliters) with about 5% alcohol.
 8 to 9 fluid ounces (240 to 270 milliliters) with about 7% alcohol.
 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) with about 12% alcohol.
 1.5 fluid ounces (45 milliliters) of an 80-proof drink, which has about 40% alcohol.
Your height and weight.
Health conditions that affect how your body processes alcohol.
Whether you've eaten recently.
Whether you've had alcohol along with other drugs, including medicines you take for health reasons.
The percentage of alcohol in your drinks.
How fast and how much alcohol you drink.
How your body processes alcohol.
 Alcohol may cause vomiting. Because it depresses the gag reflex, this increases the risk of choking on vomit if a person passes out.
 Accidentally inhaling vomit into the lungs can lead to a dangerous or fatal interruption of breathing, also known as asphyxiation.
 Vomiting can result in severe dehydration, which happens when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and a fast heart rate.
 The blood sugar level may drop low enough to cause seizures.
 The body temperature may drop so low that it leads to cardiac arrest.
 Alcohol poisoning can cause a heartbeat that is not regular. It can even cause the heart to stop.
 Heavy drinking may cause brain damage that can't be reversed.
 Any of the issues above can lead to death.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to two drinks a day for males and one drink a day for females. When you drink, enjoy your drink slowly.
 Some medicines can cause harmful effects when taken with even small amounts of alcohol. And certain health conditions may mean it takes less alcohol than expected to reach the level of alcohol poisoning. Ask your health care provider if these risks apply to you.
 Having some food in your stomach may slow the process of absorbing alcohol somewhat. But it won't prevent alcohol poisoning during binge drinking.
 Talk to your teenagers about the dangers of alcohol, including binge drinking. Evidence suggests that children who are warned about alcohol by their parents and who report close relationships with their parents are less likely to start drinking.
 If you have small children, store alcohol-containing products, including cosmetics, mouthwashes and medicines, out of their reach. Use childproof bathroom and kitchen cabinets to prevent access to household cleaners. Keep toxic items in your garage or storage area safely out of reach. Consider keeping alcoholic beverages under lock and key.
 Ask about follow-up care for alcohol poisoning. Meeting with a health care provider, particularly an experienced chemical dependency counselor, can help prevent future binge drinking.
"
Adult Still disease," Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer. 
 A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs.
 This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender.
 Joints — especially in the knees and wrists— might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks.
 Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities.
 The chronic swelling and irritation that occurs with adult Still disease can damage the joints. The most commonly involved joints are the knees and wrists. Sometimes other joints, including the neck, foot, finger and hip joints, also are affected.
 Adult Still disease can inflame the saclike covering of the heart, called the pericardium. This results in inflammation of the pericardium, called pericarditis. The disease can also inflame the muscular part of the heart, called the myocardium. This results in inflammation of the myocardium, called myocarditis.
 Inflammation may cause fluid to build up around the lungs. When this happens, it can be hard to take deep breaths.
 This is a rare but serious complication of adult Still disease. It happens when the immune system goes into overdrive and potentially harms organs such as the heart, liver, spleen and kidneys.
"
Childhood schizophrenia,"Problems with thinking and reasoning
Bizarre ideas or speech
Confusing dreams or television for reality
Withdrawal from friends and family
Trouble sleeping
Lack of motivation — for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school
Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing
Bizarre behavior
Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation
Recreational drug or nicotine use
Irritability or depressed mood
Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation
Strange anxieties and fears
Excessive suspicion of others
 These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.
 These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
 Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.
 This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.
 This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion — doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.
Less likely to have delusions
More likely to have visual hallucinations
Having a family history of schizophrenia
Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation
Older age of the father
Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development
Taking mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs during teen years
Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide
Self-injury
Anxiety disorders, panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Depression
Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine
Family conflicts
Inability to live independently, attend school or work
Social isolation
Health and medical problems
Being victimized
Legal and financial problems, and homelessness
Aggressive behavior, although uncommon

Autoimmune pancreatitis,"Dark urine.
Pale stools or stools that float in the toilet.
Yellow skin and eyes, called jaundice.
Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back.
Nausea and vomiting.
Weakness or extreme tiredness.
Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness.
Weight loss for no known reason.
In type 1 
, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2 
 affects only the pancreas. Type 2 disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease.
Type 1 
 mostly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life.
Type 2 
 affects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1 
.
Type 1 
 is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued.
Are over age 60.
Are male.
Are often one or two decades younger than those with type 1.
Are as likely to be female as male.
Are more likely to have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.
 
 may affect the ability of your pancreas to make enough enzymes. Symptoms may include diarrhea, weight loss, metabolic bone disease, and vitamin or mineral deficiency.
 Because the pancreas is the organ that produces insulin, damage to it may cause diabetes. You may need treatment with oral medicine or insulin.

Autoimmune hepatitis,"Fatigue
Abdominal discomfort
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
An enlarged liver
Abnormal blood vessels on the skin (spider angiomas)
Skin rashes
Joint pains
Loss of menstrual periods
 This is the most common type of the disease. It can occur at any age. About half the people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis.
 Although adults can develop type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, it's most common in children and young people. Other autoimmune diseases may accompany this type of autoimmune hepatitis.
 Although both males and females can develop autoimmune hepatitis, the disease is more common in females.
 Autoimmune hepatitis may develop after you're infected with the measles, herpes simplex or Epstein-Barr virus. The disease is also linked to hepatitis A, B or C infection.
 Evidence suggests that a predisposition to autoimmune hepatitis may run in families.
 People who already have an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis), may be more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis.
 When circulation through the portal vein is blocked, blood may back up into other blood vessels — mainly those in your stomach and esophagus. The blood vessels are thin walled, and because they're filled with more blood than they're meant to carry, they're likely to bleed. Massive bleeding in the esophagus or stomach from these blood vessels is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical care.
 Liver disease can cause large amounts of fluid to accumulate in your abdomen. Ascites can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing and is usually a sign of advanced cirrhosis.
 This occurs when extensive damage to liver cells makes it impossible for your liver to function adequately. At this point, a liver transplant is needed.
 People with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer.

 Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
 Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.
 Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are.
 Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.
 Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use.
 Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder.
 There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link.

"
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast," describes abnormal cells within the breast ducts.
 describes abnormal cells within the breast lobules.
 The process begins when normal cell development and growth become disrupted, causing an overproduction of normal-looking cells (hyperplasia).
 The excess cells stack upon one another and begin to take on an abnormal appearance.
 The abnormal cells continue to progress in appearance and multiply, evolving into in situ cancer, in which cancer cells remain confined to milk ducts.
 The abnormal cells accumulate within the duct and continue to multiply and transition to become cancer cells. Invasive cancer tends to invade surrounding tissue, blood vessels or lymph channels.
 about 7% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 7 can be expected to develop breast cancer five years after diagnosis. And 93 will not be diagnosed with breast cancer.
 about 13% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. That means for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 13 can be expetected to develop breast cancer 10 years after diagnosis. And 87 will not develop breast cancer.
 about 30% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 30 can be expected to develop breast cancer 25 years after diagnosis. And 70 will not develop breast cancer.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),"Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection — look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
 Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
 People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
 A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
 This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
 Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
 This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
 This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
 The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
 Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.

    

    

    
 Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
 Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean — no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
 After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).

Athlete's foot,"Scaly, peeling or cracked skin between the toes
Itchiness, especially right after taking off shoes and socks
Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color
Burning or stinging
Blisters
Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side
Frequently wear enclosed footwear
Sweat heavily
Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection
Walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers
 When you can, wear sandals to let your feet air out as much as possible.
 Use warm, soapy water and rinse and dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes. Apply a medicated foot powder (Tinactin, Gold Bond, others) or other medicated powder (Lotrimin AF, Zeasorb, others) if you're prone to athlete's foot.
 Change your socks at least once a day — more often if your feet get really sweaty. Moisture-wicking socks, such as those made from cotton, help keep your feet drier than do nylon socks.
 Use different shoes from day to day. This gives your shoes time to dry after each use.
 Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
 If you live with others, don't share shoes or unwashed bedding and towels.

Knee bursitis,"Frequent and sustained pressure, such as from kneeling, especially on hard surfaces
Overuse or strenuous activity
A direct blow to your knee
Bacterial infection of the bursa
Complications from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout in your knee
 People who work on their knees for long periods — carpet layers, plumbers and gardeners — are at increased risk of knee bursitis.
 Sports that result in direct blows or frequent falls on the knee — such as wrestling, football and volleyball — can increase your risk of knee bursitis. Runners can develop pain and inflammation in the pes anserine bursa, situated on the inner side of your knee below the joint.
 Pes anserine bursitis, affecting the inner side of your knee below the joint, often occurs in obese women with osteoarthritis.
 If you're working on your knees or participating in sports that put your knees at risk, use padding to cushion and protect your knees.
 If you're on your knees for a period of time, take regular breaks to stretch your legs and rest your knees.
 Excessive or repetitious bending of your knees increases the force on your knee joints.
 This can help take pressure off your knee joint.

Sharp or shooting pain, especially when you exercise or exert yourself
A fever
Throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head repeatedly
Leaning on your elbows for long periods
Extensive kneeling for tasks such as laying carpet or scrubbing floors
 Bursitis becomes more common with aging.
 If your work or hobby requires repetitive motion or pressure on particular bursae, your risk of developing bursitis increases. Examples include carpet laying, tile setting, gardening, painting and playing a musical instrument.
 Certain systemic diseases and conditions — such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes — increase your risk of developing bursitis. Being overweight can increase your risk of developing hip and knee bursitis.
 Use some type of padding to reduce the pressure on your knees if your job or hobby requires a lot of kneeling.
 Bend your knees when you lift. Failing to do so puts extra stress on the bursae in your hips.
 Carrying heavy loads puts stress on the bursae in your shoulders. Use a dolly or a wheeled cart instead.
 Alternate repetitive tasks with rest or other activities.
 Being overweight places more stress on your joints.

 Long-term excess alcohol intake may cause persistent ataxia. It's possible it may improve by avoiding alcohol completely.
 Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy.
 Heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury, and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia.
 Not getting enough vitamin E, vitamin B-1, vitamin B-12 or thiamine can lead to ataxia. 
 Vitamin B-6 deficiency also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because ataxia caused by these deficiencies can often be reversed.
 Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia.
 Sudden onset of ataxia occurs with a stroke. This may be either due to a blood vessel blockage or bleeding on the brain.
 This neurological disorder may cause ataxia.
 Sarcoidosis, celiac disease, certain types of encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune diseases may cause ataxia.
 Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox in childhood, and other viral infections such as 
 and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the symptoms get better over time.
 Ataxia most commonly results from severe 
 cases.
 These are rare degenerative disorders triggered by the immune system response to a cancerous tumor (neoplasm), most commonly from lung, ovarian or breast cancer or lymphoma. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed.
 An infected area (abscess) in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, a cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign) tumor, can damage the cerebellum.
 Severe brain damage may cause cerebellar ataxia weeks to months after the trauma.
 This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development — before, during or shortly after birth — that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements.
 This affects adults around age 50. In addition to ataxia, other problems associated with this condition include bladder incontinence, low blood pressure or fainting on standing, and 
 sleep behavior disorder (yelling, kicking or punching in sleep).
 Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, and there may be other neurological signs and symptoms.
 There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive — 
1 through 
7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. 
1 and 
2 are the most common. 
1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching. 
2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. There may be dizziness (vertigo), fatigue and muscle weakness during the episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms may respond to medication.

    

    

    

    
 This is the most common cause of late-onset ataxia. The ataxia symptoms are usually accompanied by dizziness, numbness or tingling in the body, and sometimes unexplained cough.

    

    

    

    
 This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth.
 People with this condition accumulate copper in the brain, liver and other organs. This can cause ataxia and other neurological problems.

Atelectasis,"Having a hard time breathing.
Rapid, weak breathing.
Wheezing.
Coughing.
 A mucus plug is a buildup of sputum or phlegm in your airways. It commonly occurs during and after surgery because you can't cough. Drugs given during surgery make you breathe less deeply. So mucus that usually would move out of your lungs may build up in your airways. Suctioning the lungs during surgery helps clear them. But sometimes mucus still builds up. Mucus plugs also are common in children, people with cystic fibrosis and during severe asthma attacks.
 Atelectasis is common in children who have inhaled an object into their lungs, such as a peanut or part of a small toy.
 A growth, which may or may not be cancer, can narrow or block the airway.
 Chest trauma, such as from a fall or car accident, can cause you to avoid taking deep breaths due to pain. This can lead to the squeezing of your lungs.
 This condition involves the buildup of fluid in the space between the lining of your lungs and the inside of your chest wall.
 Various types of pneumonia, which is a lung infection, can cause atelectasis.
 This is when air leaks into the space between your lungs and chest wall, causing some or all of a lung to collapse.
 Injury, lung disease or surgery could cause scarring.
 A large tumor can press against the lung and force air out of it.
Any condition that makes it hard to swallow.
Needing to stay in bed over a long time and not having enough changes of position.
Lung disease, such as asthma, bronchiectasis or cystic fibrosis.
Recent surgery in the stomach area or chest.
Recent general anesthesia.
Weak breathing muscles due to muscular dystrophy, spinal cord injury or another neuromuscular condition.
Medicines that may cause weak breathing.
Pain or injury that may make it painful to cough or cause weak breathing, including stomach pain or a broken rib.
Smoking.
 Atelectasis makes it harder for your lungs to get oxygen to the air sacs.
 Your risk of pneumonia continues until the atelectasis goes away. Mucus in a collapsed lung may lead to infection.
 Loss of a lobe or a whole lung, especially in an infant or someone with lung disease, can be life-threatening.

Burns," This minor burn affects only the outer layer of the skin (epidermis). It may cause redness and pain.
 This type of burn affects both the epidermis and the second layer of skin (dermis). It may cause swelling and red, white or splotchy skin. Blisters may develop, and pain can be severe. Deep second-degree burns can cause scarring.
 This burn reaches to the fat layer beneath the skin. Burned areas may be black, brown or white. The skin may look leathery. Third-degree burns can destroy nerves, causing numbness.
Burns that cover the hands, feet, face, groin, buttocks, a major joint or a large area of the body

Bulimia nervosa,"Being preoccupied with your body shape and weight 
Living in fear of gaining weight
Repeated episodes of eating abnormally large amounts of food in one sitting
Feeling a loss of control during bingeing — like you can't stop eating or can't control what you eat
Forcing yourself to vomit or exercising too much to keep from gaining weight after bingeing
Using laxatives, diuretics or enemas after eating when they're not needed
Fasting, restricting calories or avoiding certain foods between binges
Using dietary supplements or herbal products excessively for weight loss
Constantly worrying or complaining about being fat

Having damaged teeth and gums
Changing weight
Swelling in the hands and feet
Facial and cheek swelling from enlarged glands
 People with first-degree relatives (siblings, parents or children) with an eating disorder may be more likely to develop an eating disorder, suggesting a possible genetic link. Being overweight as a child or teen may increase the risk.
 Psychological and emotional problems, such as depression, anxiety disorders or substance use disorders are closely linked with eating disorders. People with bulimia may feel negatively about themselves. In some cases, traumatic events and environmental stress may be contributing factors.
 People who diet are at higher risk of developing eating disorders. Many people with bulimia severely restrict calories between binge episodes, which may trigger an urge to again binge eat and then purge. Other triggers for bingeing can include stress, poor body self-image, food and boredom.
Negative self-esteem and problems with relationships and social functioning
Dehydration, which can lead to major medical problems, such as kidney failure
Heart problems, such as an irregular heartbeat or heart failure
Severe tooth decay and gum disease
Absent or irregular periods in females

Foster and reinforce a healthy body image in your children, no matter what their size or shape. Help them build confidence in ways other than their appearance.
Have regular, enjoyable family meals.
Avoid talking about weight at home. Focus instead on having a healthy lifestyle.
Discourage dieting, especially when it involves unhealthy weight-control behaviors, such as fasting, using weight-loss supplements or laxatives, or self-induced vomiting.
Talk with your primary care provider. He or she may be in a good position to identify early indicators of an eating disorder and help prevent its development.
If you notice a relative or friend who seems to have food issues that could lead to or indicate an eating disorder, consider supportively talking to the person about these issues and ask how you can help.

 may be a sleep-related chewing activity associated with arousals during sleep.
 Increased anxiety or stress can lead to teeth grinding. So can anger and frustration. 
 Bruxism is common in young children, but it usually goes away by adulthood. 
 Having a personality type that's aggressive, competitive or hyperactive can increase your risk of bruxism.
 Bruxism may be an uncommon side effect of some psychiatric medications, such as certain antidepressants. Smoking tobacco, drinking caffeinated beverages or alcohol, or using recreational drugs may increase the risk of bruxism.
 Sleep bruxism tends to occur in families. If you have bruxism, other members of your family also may have bruxism or a history of it.
 Bruxism can be associated with some mental health and medical disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementia, gastroesophageal reflux disorder (GERD), epilepsy, night terrors, sleep-related disorders such as sleep apnea, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

 Clinical trials are studies of new treatments. These studies offer a chance to try the latest treatment options. The risk of side effects may not be known. Ask a member of your health care team whether you can participate in a clinical trial.
 Supportive care, also called palliative care, focuses on providing relief from pain and other symptoms of a serious illness. Palliative care specialists work with you, your family and your other health care team members to provide extra support. Palliative care can be used at the same time as other treatments, such as surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Often, palliative care begins as you start your astrocytoma treatments. You may not need to wait for complications to happen in order to receive palliative care.

Bloating.
Sudden, severe abdominal or pelvic pain.
Pain with fever or vomiting.
Signs of shock. These include cold, clammy skin; rapid breathing; and lightheadedness or weakness.
 About halfway through your menstrual cycle, an egg bursts out of its follicle. The egg then travels down a fallopian tube. A follicular cyst begins when the follicle doesn't rupture. It doesn't release its egg and continues to grow.
 After a follicle releases its egg, it shrinks and begins producing estrogen and progesterone. These hormones are needed for conception. The follicle is now called the corpus luteum. Sometimes, the opening where the egg came from gets blocked. Fluid builds up inside the corpus luteum, causing a cyst.
 Also called a teratoma, this cyst forms from reproductive cells that make eggs in the ovary (germ cells). The cyst can contain tissue, such as hair, skin or teeth. This type of cyst is rarely cancer.
 This type of cyst develops from cells on the surface of an ovary. The cyst might be filled with a watery or mucous material. A cystadenoma can grow very large.
 Endometriosis is a condition that causes cells similar to those that line the inside of the uterus to grow outside the uterus. Some of the tissue can attach to the ovary and form a cyst. This is called an endometrioma.
 These include taking a fertility drug that causes you to ovulate, for example clomiphene or letrozole (Femara).
 Sometimes, the follicle that forms when you ovulate stays on your ovary throughout pregnancy. It can sometimes grow larger.
 Some of the tissue can attach to your ovary and form a cyst.
 If the infection spreads to the ovaries, it can cause cysts.
 If you've had one ovarian cyst, you're likely to develop more.
 Cysts that become large can cause the ovary to move. This increases the chance of painful twisting of the ovary (ovarian torsion). If this happens, you might have sudden, severe pelvic pain and nausea and vomiting. Ovarian torsion can also reduce or stop blood flow to the ovary.
 A cyst that bursts open (ruptures) can cause severe pain and bleeding inside the pelvis. The larger the cyst, the greater the risk of rupture. Vigorous activity that affects the pelvis, such as vaginal sex, also increases the risk of rupture.

Cystic fibrosis,"A persistent cough that produces thick mucus (sputum)
Wheezing
Exercise intolerance

Recurrent sinusitis
Foul-smelling, greasy stools
Poor weight gain and growth
Intestinal blockage, particularly in newborns (meconium ileus)
Chronic or severe constipation, which may include frequent straining while trying to pass stool, eventually causing part of the rectum to protrude outside the anus (rectal prolapse)
 Cystic fibrosis is one of the leading causes of bronchiectasis, a chronic lung condition with abnormal widening and scarring of the airways (bronchial tubes). This makes it harder to move air in and out of the lungs and clear mucus from the bronchial tubes.
 Thick mucus in the lungs and sinuses provides an ideal breeding ground for bacteria and fungi. People with cystic fibrosis may often have sinus infections, bronchitis or pneumonia. Infection with bacteria that is resistant to antibiotics and difficult to treat is common.
 Because the lining inside the nose is inflamed and swollen, it can develop soft, fleshy growths (polyps).
 Bronchiectasis can occur next to blood vessels in the lungs. The combination of airway damage and infection can result in coughing up blood. Often this is only a small amount of blood, but it can also be life-threatening.
 In this condition, air leaks into the space that separates the lungs from the chest wall, and part or all of a lung collapses. This is more common in adults with cystic fibrosis. Pneumothorax can cause sudden chest pain and breathlessness. People often feel a bubbling sensation in the chest.
 Over time, cystic fibrosis can damage lung tissue so badly that it no longer works. Lung function usually worsens gradually, and it eventually can become life-threatening. Respiratory failure is the most common cause of death.
 People with cystic fibrosis may experience worsening of their respiratory symptoms, such as coughing with more mucus and shortness of breath. This is called an acute exacerbation and requires treatment with antibiotics. Sometimes treatment can be provided at home, but hospitalization may be needed. Decreased energy and weight loss also are common during exacerbations.
 Thick mucus can block the tubes that carry digestive enzymes from your pancreas to your intestines. Without these enzymes, your body can't absorb protein, fats or fat-soluble vitamins, so you can't get enough nutrients. This can result in delayed growth, weight loss or inflammation of the pancreas.
 The pancreas produces insulin, which your body needs to use sugar. Cystic fibrosis increases the risk of diabetes. About 20% of teenagers and 40% to 50% of adults with 
 develop diabetes.
 The tube that carries bile from your liver and gallbladder to your small intestine may become blocked and inflamed. This can lead to liver problems, such as jaundice, fatty liver disease and cirrhosis — and sometimes gallstones.
 Intestinal blockage can happen to people with cystic fibrosis at all ages. Intussusception, a condition in which a segment of the intestine slides inside an adjacent section of the intestine like a collapsible telescope, also can occur.
 
 is partial or complete obstruction where the small intestine meets the large intestine. 
 requires urgent treatment.
 Almost all men with cystic fibrosis are infertile because the tube that connects the testes and prostate gland (vas deferens) is either blocked with mucus or missing entirely. Certain fertility treatments and surgical procedures sometimes make it possible for men with 
 to become biological fathers.
 Although women with cystic fibrosis may be less fertile than other women, it's possible for them to conceive and to have successful pregnancies. Still, pregnancy can worsen the signs and symptoms of 
, so be sure to discuss the possible risks with your doctor.
 People with cystic fibrosis are at higher risk of developing a dangerous thinning of bones. They may also experience joint pain, arthritis and muscle pain.
 Because people with cystic fibrosis have saltier sweat, the balance of minerals in their blood may be upset. This makes them prone to dehydration, especially with exercise or in hot weather. Signs and symptoms include increased heart rate, fatigue, weakness and low blood pressure.
 Dealing with a chronic illness that has no cure may cause fear, depression and anxiety.
"
Epidermoid cysts,"A small, round bump under the skin, usually on the face, neck or trunk
A tiny blackhead plugging the central opening of the cyst
A thick, yellow, smelly material that sometimes drains from the cyst
Redness, swelling and tenderness in the area, if inflamed or infected

Ruptures or becomes painful or infected
Occurs in a spot that's constantly irritated
Bothers you for cosmetic reasons
Is in an unusual location, such as a finger and toe
Being past puberty
Having certain rare genetic disorders
Injuring the skin
 An epidermoid cyst can become tender and swollen, even if it's not infected. An inflamed cyst is difficult to remove. Your doctor is likely to postpone removing it until the inflammation subsides.
 A ruptured cyst often leads to a boil-like infection that requires prompt treatment.
 Cysts can become infected and painful (abscessed).
 In very rare cases, epidermoid cysts can lead to skin cancer.
"
Kidney cysts,"Dull pain in the back or side
Fever
Upper stomach pain
 A kidney cyst may become infected, causing fever and pain.
 A kidney cyst that bursts causes severe pain in the back or side. Sometimes a burst cyst may cause blood in the urine.
 A kidney cyst that blocks the typical flow of urine may lead to kidney swelling.
"
Ganglion cyst," Ganglion cysts most often develop along the tendons or joints of wrists or hands. The next most common locations are the ankles and feet. These cysts grow near other joints too.
 Ganglion cysts are round or oval. Some are too small to feel. The size of a cyst can change, often getting larger over time with joint movement.
 Ganglion cysts usually are painless. But if a cyst presses on a nerve or other structures, it can cause pain, tingling, numbness or muscle weakness.
 Ganglion cysts can develop in anyone, but they most often occur in women between the ages of 20 and 40.
 People who have wear-and-tear arthritis in the finger joints closest to the fingernails are at higher risk of developing ganglion cysts near those joints.
 Joints or tendons that have been injured are more likely to develop ganglion cysts.

 Nonsuicidal self-injury is usually the result of an inability to cope in healthy ways with stress and emotional pain.
 Having a hard time controlling, expressing or understanding emotions may lead to self-injury. The mix of emotions that triggers self-injury is complex. For example, there may be feelings of worthlessness, loneliness, panic, anger, guilt, rejection and self-hatred. Being bullied or having questions about sexual identity may be part of the mix of emotions.
Manage or reduce severe distress or anxiety and provide a sense of relief.

Punish oneself.
 Having friends who intentionally harm themselves makes it more likely for someone to begin self-injuring.
 Past experiences of neglect, sexual, physical or emotional abuse, or other traumatic events may increase the risk of self-injury. So can growing up and remaining in an unstable family environment. Other risk factors include questioning personal or sexual identity and social isolation.
 Being highly self-critical and struggling with problem solving increases the risk of self-injury. Also, self-injury is commonly linked with certain mental health conditions, such as borderline personality disorder, depression, anxiety disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and eating disorders.
 Being under the influence of alcohol or recreational drugs may increase the risk of self-injury.
Worsening feelings of shame, guilt and low self-esteem.
Infection, either from wounds or from sharing tools.
Permanent scars or other permanent harm to the body.
Worsening of underlying issues and conditions, if not properly treated.
Severe injury that could possibly lead to death.
 Someone at risk can be taught how to better manage stress and deal with life's problems. The person can learn healthy coping skills to use during periods of distress.
 Feeling lonely and disconnected may be a part of self-injury. Helping someone form healthy connections to people who don't self-injure can improve relationship and communication skills.
 Learn about the warning signs of self-injury and what to do when you suspect it.
 Peers tend to be loyal to their friends. Encourage children, teens and young adults to avoid secrecy and reach out for help if they have a concern about a friend or family member.
 News media, music and other highly visible outlets that feature self-injury may nudge children and young adults with mental or emotional issues to experiment. Teaching children critical thinking skills about the influences around them might reduce the harmful impact.

 Pituitary adenomas are tumors that grow in the pituitary gland. They are found at the base of the brain and are usually not cancer. These tumors sometimes make too much ACTH. This causes the adrenal glands to make extra cortisol. When Cushing syndrome happens this way, it's called Cushing disease. It happens more often in women and is the most common type of endogenous Cushing syndrome.
 Rarely, a tumor that makes too much ACTH grows in an organ that usually doesn't make ACTH. This is called ectopic ACTH production. It causes the body to make too much cortisol. These tumors can be cancerous, but aren't always. They are usually found in the lungs, pancreas, thyroid or thymus gland.

    

    

    
 Rarely, people inherit a tendency to get tumors on one or more of their endocrine glands, which are glands that make hormones. If these tumors make ACTH or cortisol, Cushing syndrome can happen.
Bone loss, also called osteoporosis, which can lead to broken bones.
High blood pressure, also called hypertension.
Type 2 diabetes.
Serious or multiple infections.
Loss of muscle mass and strength.

Scoliosis,"Uneven shoulders.
One shoulder blade that appears more prominent than the other.
Uneven waist.
One hip higher than the other.
One side of the rib cage jutting forward.
A prominence on one side of the back when bending forward.
Certain neuromuscular conditions, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy.
Birth defects affecting the development of the bones of the spine.
Previous surgery on the chest wall as a baby.
Injuries to or infections of the spine.
Spinal cord irregularities.
 Signs and symptoms typically begin in adolescence.
 Although both boys and girls develop mild scoliosis at about the same rate, girls have a much higher risk of the curve worsening and requiring treatment.
 Scoliosis can run in families, but most children with scoliosis don't have a family history of the disease.
 In severe scoliosis, the rib cage may press against the lungs, making it more difficult to breathe.
 People who had scoliosis as children may be more likely to have chronic back pain as adults, especially if their curves are large and untreated.
 As scoliosis worsens, it can cause more noticeable changes — including uneven hips and shoulders, prominent ribs, and a shift of the waist and trunk to the side. People with scoliosis often become self-conscious about their appearance.
"
Peyronie disease," The scar tissue linked with Peyronie disease also is called plaque. It's different from plaque that can build up in blood vessels or on your teeth. It can be felt under the skin of the penis as flat lumps or a band of hard tissue. The area over the scar tissue may feel tender.
 The penis might curve upward or downward or bend to one side.
 Peyronie disease might cause problems getting or keeping an erection. This also is called erectile dysfunction. Often though, people with Peyronie disease say they notice erectile dysfunction before the start of their other penile symptoms.
 The penis might become shorter during erections due to Peyronie disease.
 This symptom might happen with or without an erection.
 In some people with Peyronie disease, the erect penis might look narrow or indented. It might even take on an hourglass-like shape, with a tight, narrow band around the shaft.
 If a family member has Peyronie disease, you have a higher risk of the condition.
 People who have certain conditions that affect connective tissue in the body seem to have a higher risk of getting Peyronie disease. For example, some people with Peyronie disease also have a thick cord under the skin of the palm that can pull the fingers inward. This is called Dupuytren contracture.
 Peyronie disease can happen at any age. But it becomes more common between the ages of 45 and 70. Curving of the penis in younger men less often is due to Peyronie disease. It is more commonly called congenital penile curvature. A small amount of curvature in younger men is typical and not concerning.
Not being able to have sex.
Trouble getting or keeping an erection, also called erectile dysfunction.
Anxiety, stress, or depression over challenges having sex or the way your penis looks.
Stress on your relationship with your sexual partner.
Trouble having a child because it's challenging or not possible to have sex.
Shorter penis length.
Penile pain.
"
Undescended testicle," which moves back and forth between the scrotum and the groin. The testicle might be easily guided by hand into the scrotum during a physical exam. A retractile testicle is due to a muscle reflex in the scrotum.
 which has returned to the groin. The testicle can't be easily guided by hand into the scrotum. Another name for this is an acquired undescended testicle.
Premature birth or low birth weight.
Family history of undescended testicles.
Health conditions in the baby, such as cerebral palsy or a problem with the wall of the abdomen.
The mother having diabetes before or during pregnancy.
Alcohol use during pregnancy.
Smoking cigarettes or exposure to secondhand smoke during pregnancy.
Exposure to some pesticides during pregnancy.

    

    

    
 These problems make it harder to get a partner pregnant. They're more likely to happen in men who've had an undescended testicle. Fertility problems might be worse if an undescended testicle goes without treatment for a long time.
 This is the twisting of the cord that brings blood to the scrotum. It's a painful problem that cuts off blood to the testicle. Without quick treatment, the testicle might become so damaged that it needs to be removed with surgery.
 If a testicle is in the groin, it might get damaged from pressure against the pubic bone.
 A part of the intestines can push into the groin through a weak spot in the muscles of the stomach area. The bulge this causes can be painful.
"
Nonmelanoma skin cancer," Your health care provider will carefully check your skin. Your provider looks for other signs that may give clues about your diagnosis, such as swollen lymph nodes.
 Your provider may remove a small part of the skin lesion. The sample is tested in a lab to look for lymphoma cells.
 A sample of your blood may be analyzed to look for lymphoma cells.
 A sample of your bone marrow may be tested to look for lymphoma cells.
 Imaging tests may help your provider assess your condition. Examples of imaging tests include computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET).
 Radiation therapy uses powerful energy beams to kill cancer cells. Energy sources used during radiation include X-rays and protons. Radiation therapy can be used alone to treat cutaneous lymphoma. Sometimes it's used after surgery to kill any cancer cells that might be left.
 Your health care provider may recommend a procedure to remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue that surrounds it. This might be an option if you have one or only a few areas of cutaneous lymphoma. Surgery might be the only treatment needed. Sometimes other treatments are needed after surgery.
 Sometimes medicine can be injected into the cancer. One example is steroid drugs. This treatment is sometimes used for cutaneous lymphoma that grows very slowly.
 Chemotherapy is a drug treatment that uses chemicals to kill cancer cells. Chemotherapy drugs can be applied to the skin to control cutaneous lymphoma. Chemotherapy can also be given through a vein. This might be used if the cancer is growing quickly or is advanced.
 Targeted therapy drugs attack specific chemicals present in cancer cells. By blocking these chemicals, targeted drug treatments cause cancer cells to die. Targeted therapy drugs can be injected into the cancer to treat cutaneous lymphoma. Or the drugs can be administered through a vein.
"
Brain tumor," During this exam, a health care professional tests vision, hearing, balance, coordination, reflexes, and growth and development. This can help show which part of the brain might be affected by the tumor.
 Blood tests may reveal changes in hormone levels that show a tumor is affecting the pituitary gland.
 Imaging tests capture pictures of the brain. The pictures can show the size and location of the tumor. Imaging tests include X-rays, 
 and 
. In certain situations, other tests might be needed.
 Also called a craniotomy, this operation involves opening the skull to access the tumor.
 Also called a transsphenoidal procedure, this operation uses special surgical tools inserted through the nose. The tools go through a natural passage to get to the tumor. This approach minimizes the effect on the brain.

    

    

    
 Stereotactic radiotherapy is an intense form of radiation treatment. It aims many beams of radiation from many angles at the tumor. Stereotactic radiosurgery treatment is typically completed in one or a few treatments.
 Brachytherapy involves placing radioactive material directly into the tumor where it can radiate the tumor from the inside.

Blood in your stool
Nausea and vomiting
Diarrhea lasting more than two weeks
Unexplained weight loss
Fever in addition to any of the above symptoms 
 It's possible that a virus or bacterium may trigger Crohn's disease; however, scientists have yet to identify such a trigger. When your immune system tries to fight off an invading microorganism or environmental triggers, an atypical immune response causes the immune system to attack the cells in the digestive tract, too.
 Crohn's disease is more common in people who have family members with the disease, so genes may play a role in making people more likely to have it. However, most people with Crohn's disease do not have a family history of the disease.
 Crohn's disease can occur at any age, but you're likely to develop the condition when you're young. Most people who develop Crohn's disease are diagnosed before they're around 30 years old.
 Although Crohn's disease can affect any ethnic group, whites have the highest risk, especially people of Eastern European (Ashkenazi) Jewish descent. However, the incidence of Crohn's disease is increasing among Black people who live in North America and the United Kingdom. Crohn's disease is also being increasingly seen in the Middle Eastern population and among migrants to the United States.
 You're at higher risk if you have a first-degree relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, with the disease. As many as 1 in 5 people with Crohn's disease has a family member with the disease.
 Cigarette smoking is the most important controllable risk factor for developing Crohn's disease. Smoking also leads to more-severe disease and a greater risk of having surgery. If you smoke, it's important to stop.
 These include ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve), diclofenac sodium and others. While they do not cause Crohn's disease, they can lead to inflammation of the bowel that makes Crohn's disease worse.
 Crohn's disease can affect the entire thickness of the intestinal wall. Over time, parts of the bowel can scar and narrow, which may block the flow of digestive contents, often known as a stricture. You may require surgery to widen the stricture or sometimes to remove the diseased portion of your bowel.
 Chronic inflammation can lead to open sores (ulcers) anywhere in your digestive tract, including your mouth and anus, and in the genital area (perineum).

    

    

    
 This is a small tear in the tissue that lines the anus or in the skin around the anus where infections can occur. It's often associated with painful bowel movements and may lead to a perianal fistula.
 Diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping may make it difficult for you to eat or for your intestine to absorb enough nutrients to keep you nourished. It's also common to develop anemia due to low iron or vitamin B-12 caused by the disease.
 Having Crohn's disease that affects your colon increases your risk of colon cancer. General colon cancer screening guidelines for people without Crohn's disease call for a colonoscopy at least every 10 years beginning at age 45. In people with Crohn's disease affecting a large part of the colon, a colonoscopy to screen for colon cancer is recommended about 8 years after disease onset and generally is performed every 1 to 2 years afterward. Ask your doctor whether you need to have this test done sooner and more frequently.
 Many people with Crohn's disease may also develop a condition called hidradenitis suppurativa. This skin disorder involves deep nodules, tunnels and abscesses in the armpits, groin, under the breasts, and in the perianal or genital area.
 Crohn's disease can also cause problems in other parts of the body. Among these problems are low iron (anemia), osteoporosis, arthritis, and gallbladder or liver disease.

    

    

    
 Crohn's disease increases the risk of blood clots in veins and arteries.
"
Cryoglobulinemia," Most people with cryoglobulinemia get purple skin spots, called lesions, on their legs. On Black or brown skin, the spots might look black or brown. Some people also get open leg sores, called ulcers.
 Symptoms like those of rheumatoid arthritis are common in cryoglobulinemia.
 Cryoglobulinemia can damage the nerves at the tips of the fingers and toes. This causes numbness and other problems.
 Hepatitis C is the most common infection linked to cryoglobulinemia. Others include hepatitis B, HIV, Epstein-Barr, toxoplasmosis and malaria.
 Some cancers of the blood, such as multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, can cause cryoglobulinemia.
 Disease in which the immune system attacks healthy tissues by mistake, called autoimmune, increases the risk of getting cryoglobulinemia. Examples are lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and Sjogren syndrome.
 Cryoglobulinemia happens more often in women than in men.
 Symptoms of cryoglobulinemia most often begin in middle age.
 Cryoglobulinemia is linked with diseases such as hepatitis C, HIV, multiple myeloma, Waldenstrom macroglobulinemia, lupus and Sjogren syndrome.
"
Muscle cramp,"Cause severe discomfort.
Have leg swelling, redness or skin changes.
Come with muscle weakness.
Happen often.
Don't get better with self-care.
 A narrowing of the arteries that bring blood to the legs can cause a cramping pain in the legs and feet during exercise. These cramps usually go away soon after exercise stops.
 Pressure on the nerves in the spine also can cause cramping pain in the legs. The pain usually gets worse with walking. Walking bent slightly forward, such as when pushing a shopping cart, might ease cramping.
 Too little potassium, calcium or magnesium in the diet can cause leg cramps. Medicines often prescribed for high blood pressure can cause increased urination, which may drain the body of these minerals.
 Older people lose muscle mass. Then the muscles can't work as hard and can get stressed more easily.
 Not being in shape for an activity causes muscles to tire more easily.
 Athletes who get tired and sweat a lot while playing sports in warm weather often get muscle cramps.
 Muscle cramps are common during pregnancy.
 Having diabetes or illnesses that involve nerves, liver or thyroid can increase the risk of muscle cramps.
 Being overweight can increase the risk of muscle cramps.
 Muscles need fluids to work well. During activity, drink liquids regularly. Keep drinking water or other liquids without caffeine or alcohol after the activity.
 Stretch gently before and after using any muscle for a time. To avoid getting leg cramps at night, stretch before bedtime. Light exercise, such as riding a stationary bicycle for a few minutes before bedtime, also may help prevent cramps while you sleep.

"
Coronary artery disease," You may feel pressure or tightness in your chest. Some people say it feels like someone is standing on their chest. The chest pain usually occurs on the middle or left side of the chest. Activity or strong emotions can trigger angina. The pain usually goes away within minutes after the triggering event ends. In some people, especially women, the pain may be brief or sharp and felt in the neck, arm or back.
 You may feel like you can't catch your breath.
 If the heart can't pump enough blood to meet your body's needs, you may feel unusually tired.
 A completely blocked coronary artery will cause a heart attack. The classic signs and symptoms of a heart attack include crushing chest pain or pressure, shoulder or arm pain, shortness of breath, and sweating. Women may have less typical symptoms, such as neck or jaw pain, nausea and fatigue. Some heart attacks don't cause any noticeable signs or symptoms.
Diabetes or insulin resistance
High blood pressure
Not getting enough exercise (sedentary lifestyle)
Smoking or tobacco use
 Getting older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries.
 Men are generally at greater risk of coronary artery disease. However, the risk for women increases after menopause.
 A family history of heart disease makes you more likely to get coronary artery disease. This is especially true if a close relative (parent, sibling) developed heart disease at an early age. The risk is highest if your father or a brother had heart disease before age 55 or if your mother or a sister developed it before age 65.
 If you smoke, quit. Smoking is bad for heart health. People who smoke have a significantly increased risk of heart disease. Breathing in secondhand smoke also increases the risk.
 Uncontrolled high blood pressure can make arteries hard and stiff (arterial stiffness). The coronary arteries may become narrow, slowing blood flow.
 Too much bad cholesterol in the blood can increase the risk of atherosclerosis. Bad cholesterol is called low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. Not enough good cholesterol — called high-density lipoprotein (HDL) — also leads to atherosclerosis.
 Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease. Type 2 diabetes and coronary artery disease share some risk factors, such as obesity and high blood pressure.
 Excess body weight is bad for overall health. Obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes and high blood pressure. Ask your health care provider what a healthy weight is for you.
 Having long-term kidney disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease.
 Physical activity is important for good health. A lack of exercise (sedentary lifestyle) is linked to coronary artery disease and some of its risk factors.
 Emotional stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for coronary artery disease.
 Eating foods with a lot of saturated fat, trans fat, salt and sugar can increase the risk of coronary artery disease.
 Heavy alcohol use can lead to heart muscle damage. It can also worsen other risk factors of coronary artery disease.
 Too little and too much sleep have both been linked to an increased risk of heart disease.
 This condition causes breathing to stop and start during sleep. It can cause sudden drops in blood oxygen levels. The heart must work harder. Blood pressure goes up.
 This protein appears in higher-than-usual amounts when there's inflammation somewhere in the body. High 
 levels may be a risk factor for heart disease. It's thought that as coronary arteries narrow, the level of 
 in the blood goes up.
 This is a type of fat (lipid) in the blood. High levels may raise the risk of coronary artery disease, especially for women.
 Homocysteine is an amino acid the body uses to make protein and to build and maintain tissue. But high levels of homocysteine may increase the risk of coronary artery disease.
 This pregnancy complication causes high blood pressure and increased protein in the urine. It can lead to a higher risk of heart disease later in life.
 Diabetes or high blood pressure during pregnancy are also known risk factors for coronary artery disease.
 People who have conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus (and other inflammatory conditions) have an increased risk of atherosclerosis.
 When the coronary arteries narrow, the heart may not get enough blood when it needs it most — like when exercising. This can cause chest pain (angina) or shortness of breath.
 A heart attack can happen if a cholesterol plaque breaks open and causes a blood clot to form. A clot can block blood flow. The lack of blood can damage the heart muscle. The amount of damage depends in part on how quickly you are treated.
 Narrowed arteries in the heart or high blood pressure can slowly make the heart weak or stiff so it's harder to pump blood. Heart failure is when the heart doesn't pump blood as it should.
 Not enough blood to the heart can alter normal heart signaling, causing irregular heartbeats.
Quit smoking.
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Exercise often.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Eat a low-fat, low-salt diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
Reduce and manage stress.
"
Heart failure,"Shortness of breath with activity or when lying down.
Fatigue and weakness.
Swelling in the legs, ankles and feet.

Your symptoms suddenly become worse.
You develop a new symptom.
You gain 5 pounds (2.3 kilograms) or more within a few days.
If the heart is damaged or weakened, the heart chambers may stretch and get bigger. The heart can't pump out the needed amount of blood.
If the main pumping chambers of the heart, called the ventricles, are stiff, they can't fill with enough blood between beats.

    

    

    
 Also called hypertension, this condition forces the heart to work harder than it should to pump blood through the body. Over time, the extra work can make the heart muscle too stiff or too weak to properly pump blood.
 The valves of the heart keep blood flowing the right way. If a valve isn't working properly, the heart must work harder to pump blood. This can weaken the heart over time. Treating some types of heart valve problems may reverse heart failure.
 Myocarditis is most commonly caused by a virus, including the COVID-19 virus, and can lead to left-sided heart failure.
 If the heart and its chambers or valves haven't formed correctly, the other parts of the heart have to work harder to pump blood. This may lead to heart failure.
 Irregular heart rhythms may cause the heart to beat too fast, creating extra work for the heart. A slow heartbeat also may lead to heart failure. Treating an irregular heart rhythm may reverse heart failure in some people.
 Some long-term diseases may contribute to chronic heart failure. Examples are diabetes, 
 infection, an overactive or underactive thyroid, or a buildup of iron or protein.
Allergic reactions.
Any illness that affects the whole body.
Blood clots in the lungs.
Severe infections.
Use of certain medicines.
Viruses that attack the heart muscle.
 Narrowed arteries may limit the heart's supply of oxygen-rich blood, resulting in weakened heart muscle.
 A heart attack is a form of coronary artery disease that occurs suddenly. Damage to the heart muscle from a heart attack may mean the heart can no longer pump as well as it should.
 Having a heart valve that doesn't work properly raises the risk of heart failure.
 The heart works harder than it has to when blood pressure is high.
 Irregular heartbeats, especially if they are very frequent and fast, can weaken the heart muscle and cause heart failure.
 Some people who develop heart failure were born with problems that affect the structure or function of their heart.
 Having diabetes increases the risk of high blood pressure and coronary artery disease.
 This inability to breathe properly during sleep results in low blood-oxygen levels and an increased risk of irregular heartbeats. Both of these problems can weaken the heart.
 People who have obesity have a higher risk of developing heart failure.
 Some viral infections can damage to the heart muscle.
 The diabetes drugs rosiglitazone (Avandia) and pioglitazone (Actos) have been found to increase the risk of heart failure in some people. Don't stop taking these medicines without first talking to your health care provider.
 Other medicines that may lead to heart failure or heart problems include nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and some medicines used to treat high blood pressure, cancer, blood conditions, irregular heartbeats, nervous system diseases, mental health conditions, lung and urinary problems, and infections.
 The heart's ability to work decreases with age, even in healthy people.
 Drinking too much alcohol may weaken the heart muscle and lead to heart failure.
 If you smoke, quit. Using tobacco increases the risk of heart disease and heart failure.
 Heart failure can reduce the blood flow to the kidneys. Untreated, this can cause kidney failure. Kidney damage from heart failure can require dialysis for treatment.
 Heart failure can cause changes in the heart's size and function. These changes may damage heart valves and cause irregular heartbeats.
 Heart failure can cause fluid buildup that puts too much pressure on the liver. This fluid backup can lead to scarring, which makes it more difficult for the liver to work properly.
 If the heart is weak, there is a risk of dying suddenly due to a dangerous irregular heart rhythm.
Don't smoke.
Get plenty of exercise.
Eat healthy foods.
Maintain a healthy weight.
Reduce and manage stress.
Take medicines as directed.

Conjoined twins," Thoracopagus (thor-uh-KOP-uh-gus) twins are joined face to face at the chest. They often have a shared heart and may also share one liver and upper intestine. This is one of the most common sites of conjoined twins.
 Omphalopagus (om-fuh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined near the bellybutton. Many omphalopagus twins share the liver and some part of the upper digestive (gastrointestinal or GI) tract. Some twins share the lower part of the small intestine (ileum) and the longest part of the large intestine (colon). They generally do not share a heart.
 Pygopagus (pie-GOP-uh-gus) twins are commonly joined back to back at the base of the spine and the buttocks. Some pygopagus twins share the lower gastrointestinal (GI) tract. A few twins share the genital and urinary organs.
 Rachipagus (ray-KIP-uh-gus), also called rachiopagus (ray-kee-OP-uh-gus), twins are joined back to back along the length of the spine. This type is very rare.
 Ischiopagus (is-kee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the pelvis, either face to face or end to end. Many ischiopagus twins share the lower 
 tract, as well as the liver and genital and urinary tract organs. Each twin may have two legs or, less commonly, the twins share two or three legs.
 Parapagus (pa-RAP-uh-gus) twins are joined side to side at the pelvis and part or all of the belly (abdomen) and chest, but with separate heads. The twins can have two, three or four arms and two or three legs.
 Craniopagus (kray-nee-OP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the back, top or side of the head, but not the face. Craniopagus twins share a portion of the skull. But their brains are usually separate, though they may share some brain tissue.
 Cephalopagus (sef-uh-LOP-uh-gus) twins are joined at the head and upper body. The faces are on opposite sides of a single shared head, and they share a brain. These twins rarely survive.

Craniosynostosis,"A misshapen skull, with the shape depending on which of the sutures are affected
Development of a raised, hard ridge along affected sutures, with a change in the shape of the head that's not typical
 Premature fusion of the sagittal suture that runs from the front to the back at the top of the skull forces the head to grow long and narrow. This head shape is called scaphocephaly. Sagittal craniosynostosis is the most common type of craniosynostosis.
 Premature fusion of one of the coronal sutures (unicoronal) that run from each ear to the top of the skull may cause the forehead to flatten on the affected side and bulge on the unaffected side. It also leads to turning of the nose and a raised eye socket on the affected side. When both coronal sutures fuse prematurely (bicoronal), the head has a short and wide appearance, often with the forehead tilted forward.
 The metopic suture runs from the top of the bridge of the nose up through the midline of the forehead to the anterior fontanel and the sagittal suture. Premature fusion gives the forehead a triangular appearance and widens the back part of the head. This head shape is also called trigonocephaly.
 Lambdoid synostosis is a rare type of craniosynostosis that involves the lambdoid suture, which runs along the back of the head. It may cause one side of a baby's head to appear flat, one ear to be higher than the other ear and tilting of the top of the head to one side.
 is the most common type of craniosynostosis. Its cause is unknown, although it's thought to be a combination of genes and environmental factors.
 is caused by certain genetic syndromes, such as Apert syndrome, Pfeiffer syndrome or Crouzon syndrome, which can affect a baby's skull development. These syndromes usually also include other physical features and health problems.

 is a hole between the upper heart chambers (atria). 
 is a hole in the wall between the right and left lower heart chambers (ventricles).
 (PAY-tunt DUK-tus ahr-teer-e-O-sus) is a connection between the lung artery and the body's main artery (aorta). It's open while a baby is growing in the womb, and typically closes a few hours after birth. But in some babies, it stays open, causing incorrect blood flow between the two arteries.
 occurs when all or some of the blood vessels from the lungs (pulmonary veins) attach to a wrong area or areas of the heart.
 A baby may be born with an aortic valve that has one or two valve flaps (cusps) instead of three. This creates a small, narrowed opening for blood to pass through. The heart must work harder to pump blood through the valve. Eventually, this leads to enlarging of the heart and thickening of the heart muscle.
 A defect on or near the pulmonary valve narrows the pulmonary valve opening and slows the blood flow. 
 The tricuspid valve — which is located between the right upper heart chamber (atrium) and the right lower chamber (ventricle) — is malformed and often leaks.
A hole in the wall between the heart's lower chambers (ventricles)
A narrowed passage between the right ventricle and pulmonary artery
A shift in the connection of the aorta to the heart
Thickened muscle in the right ventricle
 The valve that lets blood out of the heart to go to the lungs (pulmonary valve) isn't formed correctly. Blood can't travel its usual route to get oxygen from the lungs. 
 The tricuspid valve isn't formed. Instead, there's solid tissue between the right upper heart chamber (atrium) and the right lower chamber (ventricle). This congenital heart defect restricts blood flow and causes the right ventricle to be underdeveloped. 
 In this serious, rare congenital heart defect, the two main arteries leaving the heart are reversed (transposed). There are two types. Complete transposition of the great arteries is typically noticed during pregnancy or soon after birth. Levo-transposition of the great arteries (L-TGA) is less common. Symptoms may not be noticed right away.
 A major part of the heart fails to develop properly. In hypoplastic left heart syndrome, the left side of the heart hasn't developed enough to effectively pump enough blood to the body.
 Having rubella during pregnancy can cause problems in a baby's heart development. A blood test done before pregnancy can determine if you're immune to rubella. A vaccine is available for those who aren't immune.
 Careful control of blood sugar before and during pregnancy can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby. Diabetes that develops during pregnancy (gestational diabetes) generally doesn't increase a baby's risk of heart defects.

		

		

	
 Drinking alcohol during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects.
 If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of a congenital heart defect in the baby.
 Congenital heart defects sometimes run in families (are inherited) and may be associated with a genetic syndrome. Many children with an extra 21st chromosome (Down syndrome) have congenital heart defects. A missing piece (deletion) of genetic material on chromosome 22 also causes heart defects.
 This serious complication may develop in babies who have a significant heart defect. Signs of congestive heart failure include rapid breathing, often with gasping breaths, and poor weight gain.
 Congenital heart defects can increase the risk of infection of the heart tissue (endocarditis), which can lead to new heart valve problems.
 A congenital heart defect or scarring from heart surgery may cause changes in the heart's rhythm.
 Children with more-serious congenital heart defects often develop and grow more slowly than do children who don't have heart defects. They may be smaller than other children of the same age. If the nervous system has been affected, a child may learn to walk and talk later than other children.
 Although uncommon, some children with congenital heart defects are at increased risk of stroke due to blood clots traveling through a hole in the heart and on to the brain.
 Some children with congenital heart defects may develop anxiety or stress because of developmental delays, activity restrictions or learning difficulties. Talk to your child's provider if you're concerned about your child's mental health.
 Regular checkups with a health care provider during pregnancy can help keep mom and baby healthy.
 Taking 400 micrograms of folic acid daily has been shown to reduce birth defects in the brain and spinal cord. It may help reduce the risk of heart defects as well.
 These lifestyle habits can harm a baby's health. Also avoid secondhand smoke.
 A rubella infection during pregnancy may affect a baby's heart development. Get vaccinated before trying to get pregnant.
 If you have diabetes, good control of your blood sugar can reduce the risk of congenital heart defects.
 If you have other health conditions, including phenylketonuria, talk to your health care provider about the best way to treat and manage them.
 During pregnancy, have someone else do any painting and cleaning with strong-smelling products.
 Some medications can cause birth defects. Tell your provider about all the medications you take, including those bought without a prescription.

Congenital heart disease in adults,"Irregular heart rhythms (arrhythmias)
Blue skin, lips and fingernails (cyanosis)
Shortness of breath
Feeling tired very quickly with activity
Swelling of body tissue or organs (edema)
The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).
The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).
In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of your heart through the pulmonary veins.
The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.
 Congenital heart disease appears to run in families (inherited). It's associated with many genetic syndromes. For instance, children with Down syndrome often have congenital heart defects. Genetic testing can detect Down syndrome and some other genetic conditions while a baby is still in the mother's womb.
 Having rubella during pregnancy may affect how the baby's heart develops while in the womb.
 Having type 1 or type 2 diabetes during pregnancy also may affect a baby's heart development. Gestational diabetes generally doesn't increase the risk of congenital heart disease.
 Taking certain medications while pregnant can cause congenital heart disease and other birth defects. Medications linked to heart defects include lithium for bipolar disorder and isotretinoin (Claravis, Myorisan, others), which is used to treat acne. Always tell your health care provider about the medications you take.
 Drinking alcohol while pregnant has been linked to an increased risk of heart defects in the baby.
 If you smoke, quit. Smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of congenital heart defects in the baby.
 Faulty heart signaling causes the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or irregularly. In some people, severe arrhythmias may cause stroke or sudden cardiac death if not treated. Scar tissue in the heart from previous surgeries can contribute to this complication.
 Bacteria or other germs can enter the bloodstream and move to the inner lining of the heart (endocardium). Untreated, this infection can damage or destroy the heart valves or cause a stroke. If you are at high risk of endocarditis, your care provider may recommend taking antibiotics one hour before dental cleanings. Regular dental checkups are important. Healthy gums and teeth reduce the risk that bacteria will enter the bloodstream.
 A congenital heart defect can allow a blood clot to pass through the heart and travel to the brain, where it reduces or blocks blood supply.
 Some congenital heart defects send more blood to the lungs, causing pressure to build. This eventually causes the heart muscle to weaken and sometimes to fail.
 Heart failure (congestive heart failure) means the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.

 Some people experience a sense of spinning or dizziness for days or weeks after a brain injury.
 A small number of people may have multiple symptoms that last longer than expected. Longer lasting symptoms may include headaches, dizziness and trouble with thinking. If these symptoms persist beyond three months, they're called persistent post-concussive symptoms.
 Researchers are studying the effects of repeated head injuries that don't cause symptoms, known as subconcussive injury. At this time, there's no conclusive evidence that these repeated brain injuries affect brain function.
 Rarely, experiencing a second concussion before symptoms of a first concussion go away may result in rapid brain swelling. This can lead to death. It's important that athletes never return to sports while they're still experiencing symptoms of concussion.

    

    

    
 Wearing a seat belt may prevent serious injury, including head injury, during a traffic accident.

 Compulsive sexual behavior, over time, might cause changes in the brain's pathways, called neural circuits. This may happen especially in areas of the brain that are related to reinforcement. Over time, more-intense sexual content and stimulation are usually needed to get satisfaction or relief.
 Certain chemicals in your brain called neurotransmitters — such as serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine — help control your mood. When these are out of balance, your sexual desire and behavior could be affected.
 Certain health conditions, such as dementia, may cause damage to parts of the brain that affect sexual behavior. Also, treatment of Parkinson's disease with certain medicines may cause compulsive sexual behavior.
 Advances in technology and social media give people easy access to intense sexual images and information.
 The secret and private nature of compulsive sexual activities can allow these problems to worsen over time.

Kleptomania,"Inability to resist powerful urges to steal items that you don't need
Feeling increased tension, anxiety or arousal leading up to the theft
Feeling pleasure, relief or satisfaction while stealing
Feeling terrible guilt, remorse, self-loathing, shame or fear of arrest after the theft
Return of the urges and a repetition of the kleptomania cycle
Unlike most shoplifters, people with kleptomania don't compulsively steal for personal gain, on a dare, for revenge or out of rebellion. They steal simply because the urge is so powerful that they can't resist it.
Episodes of kleptomania generally happen suddenly, without planning and without help from another person.
Most people with kleptomania steal from public places, such as stores. Some may steal from friends or acquaintances, such as at a party.
Often, the stolen items have no value to the person with kleptomania, and the person can afford to buy them.
The stolen items are usually stashed away, never to be used. Items also may be donated, given away to family or friends, or even secretly returned to the place from which they were stolen.
Urges to steal may come and go or may occur with greater or lesser intensity over the course of time.
You're concerned because you care about the person's health and well-being.
You're worried about the risks of compulsive stealing, such as being arrested, losing a job or damaging a valued relationship.
You understand that, with kleptomania, the urge to steal may be too strong to resist just by ""putting your mind to it.""
Treatments are available that may help to minimize the urge to steal and live without addiction and shame.
 Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, helps regulate moods and emotions. Low levels of serotonin are common in people prone to impulsive behaviors.
 Stealing may cause the release of dopamine — another neurotransmitter. Dopamine causes pleasurable feelings, and some people seek this rewarding feeling again and again.
 Urges are regulated by the brain's opioid system. An imbalance in this system could make it harder to resist urges.
 Urges are very uncomfortable. Responding to these urges by stealing causes a temporary decrease in distress and relief from these urges. This creates a strong habit that becomes hard to break.
 Having a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with kleptomania or addictive disorders may increase the risk of kleptomania.
 People with kleptomania often have another mental health disorder, such as anxiety, depression or a substance use disorder.

Common warts,"Small, fleshy, grainy bumps
Rough to the touch
Sprinkled with black pinpoints, which are small, clotted blood vessels
The growths are painful or change in appearance or color
You've tried treating the warts, but they persist, spread or recur
The growths are bothersome and interfere with activities
You aren't sure whether the growths are warts
You are an adult and numerous warts begin to appear, which may indicate the immune system is malfunctioning
Children and young adults, because their bodies may not have built up immunity to the virus
People with weakened immune systems, such as those with HIV/AIDS or people who've had organ transplants
Avoid direct contact with warts. This includes your own warts.
Don't pick at warts. Picking may spread the virus.
Don't use the same emery board, pumice stone or nail clipper on your warts as you use on your healthy skin and nails. Use a disposable emery board.
Don't bite your fingernails. Warts occur more often in skin that has been broken. Nibbling the skin around your fingernails opens the door for the virus.
Groom with care. And avoid brushing, clipping or shaving areas that have warts. If you must shave, use an electric razor.
"
Pneumothorax," Any blunt or penetrating injury to your chest can cause lung collapse. Some injuries may happen during physical assaults or car crashes, while others may inadvertently occur during medical procedures that involve the insertion of a needle into the chest.
 Damaged lung tissue is more likely to collapse. Lung damage can be caused by many types of underlying diseases, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, lung cancer or pneumonia. Cystic lung diseases, such as lymphangioleiomyomatosis and Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, cause round, thin-walled air sacs in the lung tissue that can rupture, resulting in pneumothorax.
 Small air blisters (blebs) can develop on the top of the lungs. These air blisters sometimes burst — allowing air to leak into the space that surrounds the lungs.
 A severe type of pneumothorax can occur in people who need mechanical assistance to breathe. The ventilator can create an imbalance of air pressure within the chest. The lung may collapse completely.
 The risk increases with the length of time and the number of cigarettes smoked, even without emphysema.
 Certain types of pneumothorax appear to run in families.
 Anyone who has had one pneumothorax is at increased risk of another.
"
Ischemic colitis,"Pain, tenderness or cramping in your belly, which can occur suddenly or happen over time
Bright red or maroon blood in your stool or, at times, passage of blood alone without stool
A feeling of urgency to move your bowels
Diarrhea
Nausea
Buildup of fatty deposits on the walls of an artery, also called atherosclerosis
Low blood pressure, also called hypotension, associated with dehydration, heart failure, surgery, trauma or shock
Bowel obstruction caused by a hernia, scar tissue or a tumor

Hormone medicines, such as estrogen
Antibiotics
Pseudoephedrine
Opioids
Certain medicines for irritable bowel syndrome
Chemotherapy medicines
 The condition occurs mostly frequently in adults older than age 60. Ischemic colitis that occurs in a young adult may be a sign of a blood-clotting irregularity. Or it also may be due to inflammation of the blood vessels, also known as vasculitis.
 Ischemic colitis is more common in women.
 Conditions that affect the way the blood clots, such as factor V Leiden, may increase the risk of ischemic colitis.
 which can lead to atherosclerosis.
 due to heart failure, low blood pressure or shock. It may also be caused by certain conditions, such as diabetes or rheumatoid arthritis.
 Scar tissue that forms after surgery may cause reduced blood flow.
 such as marathon running, which can lead to reduced blood flow to the colon.

"
Ulcerative colitis,"Diarrhea, often with blood or pus
Rectal bleeding — passing small amount of blood with stool
Abdominal pain and cramping
Rectal pain
Urgency to defecate
Inability to defecate despite urgency
Weight loss
Fatigue
Fever
In children, failure to grow
 Inflammation is confined to the area closest to the anus, also called the rectum. Rectal bleeding may be the only sign of the disease.
 Inflammation involves the rectum and sigmoid colon — the lower end of the colon. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramps and pain, and an inability to move the bowels despite the urge to do so. This is called tenesmus.
 Inflammation extends from the rectum up through the sigmoid and descending portions of the colon. Symptoms include bloody diarrhea, abdominal cramping and pain on the left side, and urgency to defecate.
 This type often affects the entire colon and causes bouts of bloody diarrhea that may be severe, abdominal cramps and pain, fatigue, and significant weight loss.
Abdominal pain
Blood in your stool
Ongoing diarrhea that doesn't respond to nonprescription medications
Diarrhea that awakens you from sleep
An unexplained fever lasting more than a day or two
 Ulcerative colitis usually begins before the age of 30, but it can occur at any age. Some people may not develop the disease until after age 60.
 Although white people have the highest risk of the disease, it can occur in any race. If you're of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, your risk is even higher.
 You're at higher risk if you have a close relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, with the disease.
Severe bleeding
Severe dehydration
A rapidly swelling colon, also called a toxic megacolon
A hole in the colon, also called a perforated colon
Increased risk of blood clots in veins and arteries
Inflammation of the skin, joints and eyes
An increased risk of colon cancer
Bone loss, also called osteoporosis
"
Coma,"Closed eyes.
Depressed brainstem reflexes, such as pupils not responding to light.
No responses of limbs except for reflex movements.
No response to painful stimuli except for reflex movements.
Irregular breathing.
 These are often caused by traffic collisions or acts of violence.
 Reduced or stopped blood supply to the brain, known as a stroke, can result from blocked arteries or a burst blood vessel.
 Tumors in the brain or brainstem can cause a coma.
 Blood sugar levels that become too high or too low can cause a coma.
 People who have been rescued from drowning or revived after a heart attack might not awaken due to lack of oxygen to the brain.
 Infections such as encephalitis and meningitis cause swelling of the brain, spinal cord or the tissues that surround the brain. Severe cases of these infections can result in brain damage or a coma.
 Ongoing seizures can lead to a coma.
 Exposure to toxins, such as carbon monoxide or lead, can cause brain damage and a coma.
 Overdosing on drugs or alcohol can result in a coma.

Touching your eyes, nose or mouth after contact with the virus.
 Infants and young children have a greater risk of colds than other people, especially if they spend time in child care settings.
 Having a long-term illness or weakened immune system increases your risk.
 Both children and adults are more likely to get colds in fall and winter.
 Smoking or being around secondhand smoke increases the risk of catching a cold.
 Being in crowds, such as at school or on an airplane, increases the chance of getting a cold.
 This is the swelling and build-up of fluids in the space behind the eardrum. It may be caused by a virus or bacteria. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches or the return of a fever following a common cold.
 A cold can trigger wheezing, even in people who don't have asthma. For people with asthma, a cold can make it worse.
 In adults or children, a common cold that lasts a while can lead to swelling and pain in the sinuses. These are air-filled spaces in the skull above the eyes and around the nose. A virus or bacteria may cause sinusitis.
 A common cold can lead to illnesses of the lungs, such as pneumonia or bronchitis. People with asthma or weakened immune systems have an increased risk of these conditions.
 Wash your hands well and often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer with at least 60% alcohol. Teach your children the importance of hand-washing. Try not to touch your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands.
 Clean and disinfect surfaces that are touched often. These include doorknobs, light switches, electronics, and kitchen and bathroom countertops. This is especially important when someone in your family has a cold. Wash children's toys often.
 Sneeze and cough into tissues. Throw away used tissues right away, and then wash your hands. If you don't have a tissue, sneeze or cough into the bend of your elbow, and then wash your hands.
 Don't share drinking glasses or silverware with other family members.
 Avoid close contact with anyone who has a cold. Stay out of crowds when possible. Try not to touch your eyes, nose and mouth when you're in crowds.
 Look for a child care setting with good hygiene practices and clear policies about keeping sick children at home.
 Eat well, exercise and get plenty of sleep to help you stay healthy.
"
Cold sore," Many people feel itching, burning or tingling around the lips for a day or so before a small, hard, painful spot appears and blisters form.
 Small fluid-filled blisters often form along the border of the lips. Sometimes they appear around the nose or cheeks or inside the mouth.
 The small blisters may merge and then burst. This can leave shallow open sores that ooze and crust over.

 Both 
 and 
 can be spread to the fingers. This type of infection is often referred to as herpes whitlow. Children who suck their thumbs may transfer the infection from their mouths to their thumbs.
 The virus can sometimes cause eye infection. Repeated infections can cause scarring and injury, which may lead to vision problems or loss of vision.
 People who have a skin condition called atopic dermatitis (eczema) are at higher risk of cold sores spreading all across their bodies. This can become a medical emergency.
 The virus spreads most easily when the blisters leak fluid.
 Utensils, towels, lip balm and other personal items can spread the virus when blisters are present.
 When you have a cold sore, wash your hands carefully before touching yourself and other people, especially babies.
"
Hypothermia,"Shivering
Slurred speech or mumbling
Slow, shallow breathing
Weak pulse
Clumsiness or lack of coordination
Drowsiness or very low energy
Confusion or memory loss
Loss of consciousness
Bright red, cold skin (in infants)
Wearing clothes that aren't warm enough for weather conditions
Staying out in the cold too long
Being unable to get out of wet clothes or move to a warm, dry location
Falling into the water, as in a boating accident
Living in a house that's too cold, either from poor heating or too much air conditioning
 Most heat loss is due to heat radiated from unprotected surfaces of your body.
 If you're in direct contact with something very cold, such as cold water or the cold ground, heat is conducted away from your body. Because water is very good at transferring heat from your body, body heat is lost much faster in cold water than in cold air. Similarly, heat loss from your body is much faster if your clothes are wet, as when you're caught out in the rain.
 Wind removes body heat by carrying away the thin layer of warm air at the surface of your skin. A wind chill factor is important in causing heat loss.
 Your tolerance for cold diminishes when you are fatigued.
 The body's ability to regulate temperature and to sense cold may lessen with age. And some older adults may not be able to communicate when they are cold or to move to a warm location if they do feel cold.
 Children lose heat faster than adults do. Children may also ignore the cold because they're having too much fun to think about it. And they may not have the judgment to dress properly in cold weather or to get out of the cold when they should.
 People with a mental illness, dementia or other conditions that interfere with judgment may not dress appropriately for the weather or understand the risk of cold weather. People with dementia may wander from home or get lost easily, making them more likely to be stranded outside in cold or wet weather.

    

    

    
 Some health disorders affect your body's ability to regulate body temperature. Examples include an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism), poor nutrition or anorexia nervosa, diabetes, stroke, severe arthritis, Parkinson's disease, trauma, and spinal cord injuries.
 Some drugs can change the body's ability to regulate its temperature. Examples include certain antidepressants, antipsychotics, narcotic pain medications and sedatives.
Freezing of body tissues (frostbite)
Decay and death of tissue resulting from an interruption in blood flow (gangrene)
 Wear a hat or other protective covering to prevent body heat from escaping from your head, face and neck. Cover your hands with mittens instead of gloves.
 Avoid activities that would cause you to sweat a lot. The combination of wet clothing and cold weather can cause you to lose body heat more quickly.
 Wear loosefitting, layered, lightweight clothing. Outer clothing made of tightly woven, water-repellent material is best for wind protection. Wool, silk or polypropylene inner layers hold body heat better than cotton does.
 Stay as dry as possible. Get out of wet clothing as soon as possible. Be especially careful to keep your hands and feet dry, as it's easy for snow to get into mittens and boots.
Dress infants and young children in one more layer than an adult would wear in the same conditions.
Bring children indoors if they start shivering — that's the first sign that hypothermia is starting.
Have children come inside frequently to warm themselves when they're playing outside.
Don't let babies sleep in a cold room.
If you're going to be outside in cold weather
If you're boating
Before going to bed on cold nights
 If you plan to ride in a watercraft, wear a life jacket. A life jacket can help you stay alive longer in cold water by enabling you to float without using energy and by providing some insulation. Keep a whistle attached to your life jacket to signal for help.
 Get out of the water as much as possible, such as climbing onto a capsized boat or grabbing onto a floating object.
 Unless a boat, another person or a life jacket is close by, stay put. Swimming will use up energy and may shorten survival time.
 Use a body position known as the heat escape lessening posture (HELP) to reduce heat loss while you wait for assistance. Hold your knees to your chest to protect the trunk of your body. If you're wearing a life jacket that turns your face down in this position, bring your legs tightly together, your arms to your sides and your head back.
 If you've fallen into cold water with other people, keep warm by facing each other in a tight circle.
 While you're in the water, don't remove clothing because it helps to insulate you from the water. Buckle, button and zip up your clothes. Cover your head if possible. Remove clothing only after you're safely out of the water and can take measures to get dry and warm.

"
Clubfoot,"The top of the foot is usually twisted downward and inward, increasing the arch and turning the heel inward.
The foot may be turned so severely that it actually looks as if it's upside down.
The affected leg or foot may be slightly shorter.
The calf muscles in the affected leg are usually underdeveloped.
 If either of the parents or their other children have had clubfoot, the baby is more likely to have it as well.
 In some cases, clubfoot can be associated with other abnormalities of the skeleton that are present at birth (congenital), such as spina bifida, a birth defect that occurs when the spine and spinal cord don't develop or close properly.
 Smoking during pregnancy can significantly increase the baby's risk of clubfoot.
 Too little of the fluid that surrounds the baby in the womb may increase the risk of clubfoot.
 The affected foot may be slightly less flexible.
 The affected leg may be slightly shorter, but generally does not cause significant problems with mobility.
 The affected foot may be up to 1 1/2 shoe sizes smaller than the unaffected foot.
 The muscles of the calf on the affected side may always be smaller than those on the other side.
 Your child is likely to develop arthritis.
 The unusual appearance of the foot may make your child's body image a concern during the teen years.
 The twist of the ankle may not allow your child to walk on the sole of the foot. To compensate, he or she may walk on the ball of the foot, the outside of the foot or even the top of the foot in severe cases.
 Walking adjustments may prevent natural growth of the calf muscles, cause large sores or calluses on the foot, and result in an awkward gait.
Not smoking or spending time in smoky environments
Not drinking alcohol
Avoiding drugs not approved by your doctor

Color blindness,"Different shades of red and green
Different shades of blue and yellow
Any colors




 Some conditions that can cause color deficits are sickle cell anemia, diabetes, macular degeneration, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, glaucoma, Parkinson's disease, chronic alcoholism and leukemia. One eye may be more affected than the other, and the color deficit may get better if the underlying disease can be treated.
 Some medications can alter color vision, such as some drugs that treat certain autoimmune diseases, heart problems, high blood pressure, erectile dysfunction, infections, nervous disorders and psychological problems.
 Your ability to see colors deteriorates slowly as you age.
 Exposure to some chemicals in the workplace, such as carbon disulfide and fertilizers, may cause loss of color vision.
"
Cluster headache,"Extreme sharp or stabbing pain, usually in, behind or around one eye. The pain can spread to other areas of the face, head and neck.
Pain on one side of the head in a single cluster. Pain can switch to the other side in another cluster.
Restlessness.
A lot of tears.
Redness of the eye on the side that hurts.
Stuffy or runny nose on the side that hurts.
Forehead or facial sweating.
Skin color changes on the side of the face that hurts.
Swelling around the eye on the side that hurts.
Drooping eyelid on the side that hurts.
Headaches usually come every day, often several times a day.
A single attack can last from 15 minutes to three hours, but more often lasts 30 to 45 minutes.
The attacks often occur at the same time each day.
Most attacks occur at night, usually 1 to 2 hours after bedtime.
A severe headache that comes on all of a sudden, often like a clap of thunder.
A headache with a fever, nausea or vomiting, a stiff neck, confusion, seizures, numbness, or trouble speaking. These might point to a stroke, meningitis, encephalitis, a brain tumor or other problems.
A headache after a head injury, especially if it gets worse — even if the injury was a minor fall or bump.
A sudden, severe headache unlike any other.
A headache that worsens over days and changes in pattern.
 Men are more likely to have cluster headaches than women are.
 Most people who develop cluster headaches are between ages 20 and 50. But the condition can start at any age.
 Many people who get cluster headaches are smokers. But quitting smoking usually doesn't stop the headaches.
 If you have cluster headaches, drinking alcohol during a cluster period may increase the risk of an attack.
 Having a parent, brother or sister who has cluster headache might increase the risk.

 Microscopic colitis is most common in people older than age 50.
 Women are more likely to have microscopic colitis than are men. Some studies suggest a link between post-menopausal hormone therapy and microscopic colitis.
 People with microscopic colitis sometimes also have an autoimmune disorder, such as celiac disease, thyroid disease, rheumatoid arthritis, type 1 diabetes or psoriasis.
 Research suggests that there may be a link between microscopic colitis and a family history of irritable bowel syndrome.
 Recent research studies have shown a link between tobacco smoking and microscopic colitis, mostly in people ages 16 to 44.

 People with depression appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain, but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
 Neurotransmitters are naturally occurring brain chemicals that likely play a role in depression. Recent research indicates that changes in the function and effect of these neurotransmitters and how they interact with neurocircuits involved in maintaining mood stability may play a significant role in depression and its treatment.
 Changes in the body's balance of hormones may be involved in causing or triggering depression. Hormone changes can result with pregnancy and during the weeks or months after delivery (postpartum) and from thyroid problems, menopause or a number of other conditions.
 Depression is more common in people whose blood relatives also have this condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing depression.

Cleft lip and cleft palate,"A split in the lip and roof of the mouth (palate) that affects one or both sides of the face
A split in the lip that appears as only a small notch in the lip or extends from the lip through the upper gum and palate into the bottom of the nose
A split in the roof of the mouth that doesn't affect the appearance of the face
Difficulty with feedings
Difficulty swallowing, with potential for liquids or foods to come out the nose
Nasal speaking voice
Chronic ear infections
 Parents with a family history of cleft lip or cleft palate face a higher risk of having a baby with a cleft.
 Cleft lip and cleft palate may be more likely to occur in pregnant women who smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol or take certain medications.
 There is some evidence that women diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy may have an increased risk of having a baby with a cleft lip with or without a cleft palate.
 There is some evidence that babies born to obese women may have increased risk of cleft lip and palate.
 One of the most immediate concerns after birth is feeding. While most babies with cleft lip can breast-feed, a cleft palate may make sucking difficult.
 Babies with cleft palate are especially at risk of developing middle ear fluid and hearing loss.
 If the cleft extends through the upper gum, tooth development may be affected.
 Because the palate is used in forming sounds, the development of normal speech can be affected by a cleft palate. Speech may sound too nasal.
 Children with clefts may face social, emotional and behavioral problems due to differences in appearance and the stress of intensive medical care.
 If you have a family history of cleft lip and cleft palate, tell your doctor before you become pregnant. Your doctor may refer you to a genetic counselor who can help determine your risk of having children with cleft lip and cleft palate.
 If you're planning to get pregnant soon, ask your doctor if you should take prenatal vitamins.
 Use of alcohol or tobacco during pregnancy increases the risk of having a baby with a birth defect.
"
Colon polyps," Constipation or diarrhea that lasts longer than a week may mean the presence of a larger colon polyp or cancer. However, several other conditions also can cause changes in bowel habits.
 Blood can show up as red streaks in your stool or make stool appear black. A change in color also may be caused by certain foods, medicines or dietary supplements.
 Bleeding from polyps can happen slowly over time, without visible blood in your stool. Chronic bleeding may lead to iron deficiency anemia, which can make you feel tired and short of breath.
 A large colon polyp can block part of your bowel, leading to crampy abdominal pain.
 This can be a sign of colon polyps or cancer or other conditions, such as hemorrhoids or minor tears of the anus.
Abdominal pain.
Blood in your stool.
A change in your bowel habits that lasts longer than a week.
You're age 50 or older.
You have risk factors, such as a family history of colon cancer. Some high-risk individuals should begin regular screening much earlier than age 50.
 Most people with colon polyps are 50 or older.
 Ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease of the colon increase your overall risk of colon cancer, although the polyps themselves are not a significant threat.
 You're more likely to get colon polyps or cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with them. If many family members have them, your risk is even greater. In some people, this connection isn't hereditary.
 Studies show that people who have three or more alcoholic drinks a day have an increased risk of getting colon polyps. Alcohol intake combined with smoking also appears to increase the risk.
 You're at a higher risk if you are overweight, don't exercise regularly and lack a healthy diet.
 Black Americans have a higher risk of developing colon cancer.
 also called hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer. People with Lynch syndrome tend to develop relatively few colon polyps, but those polyps can quickly become cancerous. Lynch syndrome is the most common form of inherited colon cancer and also is associated with tumors in other parts of the abdomen.
 a rare disorder that causes hundreds or even thousands of polyps to develop in the lining of your colon beginning during your teenage years. If the polyps aren't treated, your risk of developing colon cancer is nearly 100%, usually before age 40. Genetic testing can help determine your risk of 
.
 a variant of 
 that causes polyps to develop throughout your colon and small intestine. You also may develop noncancerous tumors in other parts of your body, including your skin, bones and abdomen.
 a condition similar to 
 that is caused by changes in the MYH gene. People with 
 often develop multiple adenomatous polyps and colon cancer at a young age. Genetic testing can help determine your risk of 
.
 a condition that usually begins with freckles developing all over the body, including the lips, gums and feet. Then noncancerous polyps develop throughout the intestines. These polyps may become cancerous, so people with this condition have a higher risk of colon cancer.
 a condition that leads to multiple serrated adenomatous polyps in the upper part of the colon. These polyps may become cancerous. They need to be watched and possibly removed.
 Include plenty of fruits, vegetables and whole grains in your diet and reduce your fat intake. Limit alcohol and quit all tobacco use. Stay physically active and maintain a healthy body weight.
 Studies have shown that increasing the intake of calcium may help prevent the return of colon adenomas. But it isn't clear whether calcium has any protective benefits against colon cancer. Other studies have shown that vitamin D may protect against colorectal cancer.
 If you have a family history of colon polyps, consider having genetic counseling. If you've been diagnosed with a hereditary disorder that causes colon polyps, you'll need regular colonoscopies starting in young adulthood.

 Excessive alcohol consumption is a risk factor for cirrhosis.
 Being obese increases your risk of conditions that may lead to cirrhosis, such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
 Not everyone with chronic hepatitis will develop cirrhosis, but it's one of the world's leading causes of liver disease.
 This condition is known as portal hypertension. Cirrhosis slows the regular flow of blood through the liver. This increases pressure in the vein that brings blood to the liver.
 The increased pressure in the portal vein can cause fluid to accumulate in the legs, called edema, and in the abdomen, called ascites. Edema and ascites also may happen if the liver can't make enough of certain blood proteins, such as albumin.
 Portal hypertension can cause the spleen to trap white blood cells and platelets. This makes the spleen swell, a condition known as splenomegaly. Fewer white blood cells and platelets in your blood can be the first sign of cirrhosis.
 Portal hypertension can cause blood to be redirected to smaller veins. Strained by the extra pressure, these smaller veins can burst, causing serious bleeding. Portal hypertension also may cause enlarged veins, called varices (VAIR-uh-seez), in the esophagus or the stomach. These varices also may lead to life-threatening bleeding. If the liver can't make enough clotting factors, this also can contribute to continued bleeding.
 If you have cirrhosis, your body may have a hard time fighting infections. Ascites can lead to bacterial peritonitis, a serious infection.
 Cirrhosis may make it more difficult for your body to process nutrients, leading to weakness and weight loss.
 A liver damaged by cirrhosis can't clear toxins from the blood as well as a healthy liver can. These toxins can then build up in the brain and cause mental confusion and difficulty concentrating. This is known as hepatic encephalopathy. With time, hepatic encephalopathy can progress to unresponsiveness or coma.
 Jaundice occurs when the diseased liver doesn't remove enough bilirubin, a blood waste product, from your blood. Jaundice causes yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes and darkening of urine.
 Some people with cirrhosis lose bone strength and are at greater risk of fractures.
 A large proportion of people who develop liver cancer have pre-existing cirrhosis.
 Some people end up experiencing multiorgan failure. Researchers now believe this is a complication in some people who have cirrhosis. However, they don't fully understand what causes it.
 If you have liver disease, you should not drink alcohol.
 Choose a diet that's full of fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean sources of protein. Cut down on the amount of fatty and fried foods you eat.
 Too much body fat can damage your liver. Talk to your health care provider about a weight-loss plan if you are obese or overweight.
 Sharing needles and having unprotected sex can increase your risk of hepatitis B and C. Ask your provider about hepatitis vaccinations.

Dull aching.
Sharp pains or cramping.
Pressure or heaviness deep within the pelvis.
During sex.
While having a bowel movement or urinating.
When you sit or stand for a long time.
An urgent or frequent need to urinate.
Bloating.
Upset stomach.
Constipation or diarrhea.
 This is a disease where tissue that's like the lining of the uterus grows outside the uterus. It may cause pain or infertility.
 Health issues that affect bones, joints and connective tissues can lead to pelvic pain that keeps coming back. These problems include fibromyalgia, tension in pelvic floor muscles, swelling of the pubic joint or hernia.
 This can happen if a long-term infection, often spread through sex, causes scarring that involves the pelvic organs.
 After surgery to remove one or both ovaries, a small piece of ovary may be left inside by mistake. Later, this leftover tissue may form painful cysts.
 These growths inside, on or attached to the uterus aren't cancer. But they may cause pressure or a feeling of heaviness in the lower stomach area or lower back. Rarely, they cause sharp pain.
 Symptoms linked with irritable bowel syndrome — bloating, constipation or diarrhea — can be a source of pelvic pain and pressure.
 This is also called interstitial cystitis. It's linked with pain in your bladder that keeps coming back. It's also tied to a frequent need to urinate. You may have pelvic pain as your bladder fills. The pain may get better for a while after you empty your bladder.
 Enlarged, varicose-type veins around the uterus and ovaries can lead to pelvic pain.
 Depression, long-term stress or a history of sexual or physical abuse may raise your risk of chronic pelvic pain. Emotional distress makes pain worse. And long-term pain can fuel distress. These two factors often become a vicious cycle.

 If a sinus infection spreads to an eye socket, it can reduce vision or possibly cause blindness.
 It's not common. But a serious sinus infection can spread to the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord. The infection is called meningitis. Other serious infections can spread to the bones, called osteomyelitis, or to skin, called cellulitis.
 Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, especially before meals.
 Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control. Stay away from things you're allergic to when possible.
 Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate the lungs and inside the nose, called the nasal passages.
 If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air with a humidifier may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.

 Taking headache medications, including over-the-counter medications, more than twice a week can increase the severity and frequency of your headaches. Consult your doctor about how to wean yourself off the medication because there can be serious side effects if done improperly.
 The average adult needs seven to eight hours of sleep a night. It's best to go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. Talk to your doctor if you have sleep disturbances, such as snoring.
 Eat healthy meals at about the same times daily. Avoid food or drinks, such as those containing caffeine, that seem to trigger headaches. Lose weight if you're obese.
 Regular aerobic physical activity can improve your physical and mental well-being and reduce stress. With your doctor's OK, choose activities you enjoy — such as walking, swimming or cycling. To avoid injury, start slowly.
 Stress is a common trigger of chronic headaches. Get organized. Simplify your schedule. Plan ahead. Stay positive. Try stress-reduction techniques, such as yoga, tai chi or meditation.
 While some headache medications include caffeine because it can be beneficial in reducing headache pain, it can also aggravate headaches. Try to minimize or eliminate caffeine from your diet.

Chronic cough,"A runny or stuffy nose
A feeling of liquid running down the back of your throat (postnasal drip)
Frequent throat clearing and sore throat
Hoarseness
Wheezing and shortness of breath
Heartburn or a sour taste in your mouth
In rare cases, coughing up blood
 When your nose or sinuses produce extra mucus, it can drip down the back of your throat and trigger your cough reflex. This condition is also called upper airway cough syndrome (UACS).
 An asthma-related cough may come and go with the seasons, appear after an upper respiratory tract infection, or become worse when you're exposed to cold air or certain chemicals or fragrances. In one type of asthma (cough-variant asthma), a cough is the main symptom.
 In this common condition, stomach acid flows back into the tube that connects your stomach and throat (esophagus). The constant irritation can lead to chronic coughing. The coughing, in turn, worsens GERD — a vicious cycle.
 A cough can linger long after other symptoms of pneumonia, flu, a cold or other infection of the upper respiratory tract have gone away. A common but under-recognized cause of a chronic cough in adults is pertussis, also known as whooping cough. Chronic cough can also occur with fungal infections of the lung, tuberculosis (TB) infection or lung infection with nontuberculous mycobacterial organisms.
 COPD, a chronic inflammatory lung disease that causes obstructed airflow from the lungs, includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema. Chronic bronchitis can cause a cough that brings up colored sputum. Emphysema causes shortness of breath and damages the air sacs in the lungs (alveoli). Most people with COPD are current or former smokers.
 Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are commonly prescribed for high blood pressure and heart failure, are known to cause chronic cough in some people.

Cholecystitis,"Severe pain in your upper right or center abdomen
Pain that spreads to your right shoulder or back
Tenderness over your abdomen when it's touched
Nausea
Vomiting
Fever
 Most often, cholecystitis is the result of hard particles that develop in your gallbladder (gallstones). Gallstones can block the tube (cystic duct) through which bile flows when it leaves the gallbladder. Bile builds up in the gallbladder, causing inflammation.
 A tumor may prevent bile from draining out of your gallbladder properly. This causes bile buildup that can lead to cholecystitis.
 Stones or thickened bile and tiny particles (sludge) can block the bile duct and lead to cholecystitis. Kinking or scarring of the bile ducts can also cause blockage.
 
 and certain viral infections can trigger gallbladder inflammation.
 Very severe illness can damage blood vessels and decrease blood flow to the gallbladder, leading to cholecystitis.
 If bile builds up within your gallbladder, causing cholecystitis, the bile may become infected.
 Untreated cholecystitis can cause tissue in the gallbladder to die (gangrene). It's the most common complication, especially among older people, those who wait to get treatment and those with diabetes. This can lead to a tear in the gallbladder, or it may cause your gallbladder to burst.
 A tear (perforation) in your gallbladder may result from gallbladder swelling, infection or death of tissue.
 Rapid weight loss can increase the risk of gallstones.
 Being overweight makes you more likely to develop gallstones. To achieve a healthy weight, reduce calories and increase your physical activity. Maintain a healthy weight by continuing to eat well and exercise.
 Diets high in fat and low in fiber may increase the risk of gallstones. To lower your risk, choose a diet high in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.

Abdominal pain
Fever
Chills
Night sweats
Enlarged liver
Enlarged spleen
Weight loss
 Primary sclerosing cholangitis can occur at any age, but it's most often diagnosed between the ages of 30 and 40.
 Primary sclerosing cholangitis occurs more often in men.
 A large proportion of people with primary sclerosing cholangitis also have inflammatory bowel disease.
 People with Northern European heritage have a higher risk of primary sclerosing cholangitis.
 Chronic inflammation of the bile ducts throughout your liver can lead to tissue scarring (cirrhosis), liver cell death and, eventually, loss of liver function.
 If scarring of the bile ducts slows or stops the flow of bile out of the liver, you may experience frequent infections in the bile ducts. The risk of infection is particularly high after you've had a surgical procedure to expand a badly scarred bile duct or remove a stone blocking a bile duct.

    

    

    
 People with primary sclerosing cholangitis may experience thinning bones (osteoporosis). Your doctor may recommend a bone density exam to test for osteoporosis every few years. Calcium and vitamin D supplements may be prescribed to help prevent bone loss.
 If you have primary sclerosing cholangitis, you have an increased risk of developing cancer in the bile ducts or gallbladder.
 People with primary sclerosing cholangitis associated with inflammatory bowel disease have an increased risk of colon cancer. If you've been diagnosed with primary sclerosing cholangitis, your doctor may recommend testing for inflammatory bowel disease, even if you have no signs or symptoms, since the risk of colon cancer is elevated if you have both diseases.

Chest tightness
A chronic cough that may produce mucus (sputum) that may be clear, white, yellow or greenish
Frequent respiratory infections
Lack of energy
Unintended weight loss (in later stages)
Swelling in ankles, feet or legs
 This lung disease causes destruction of the fragile walls and elastic fibers of the alveoli. Small airways collapse when you exhale, impairing airflow out of your lungs.
 In this condition, your bronchial tubes become inflamed and narrowed and your lungs produce more mucus, which can further block the narrowed tubes. You develop a chronic cough trying to clear your airways.
 The most significant risk factor for 
 is long-term cigarette smoking. The more years you smoke and the more packs you smoke, the greater your risk. Pipe smokers, cigar smokers and marijuana smokers also may be at risk, as well as people exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke.
 Asthma, a chronic inflammatory airway disease, may be a risk factor for developing 
. The combination of asthma and smoking increases the risk of 
 even more.
 Long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs.
 In the developing world, people exposed to fumes from burning fuel for cooking and heating in poorly ventilated homes are at higher risk of developing

Tenderness when you push on your chest
Pain that continues for many hours
 This is chest pain caused by poor blood flow to the heart. This is often caused by the buildup of thick plaques on the inner walls of the arteries that carry blood to the heart. These plaques narrow the arteries and restrict the heart's blood supply, particularly during physical activity.
 A heart attack results from blocked blood flow to the heart muscle, often from a blood clot. Angina can be the main symptom felt during a heart attack.
 This life-threatening condition involves the main artery leading from the heart, called the aorta. If the inner layers of this blood vessel separate, blood is forced between the layers and can cause the aorta to rupture.
 This condition usually causes sharp pain that gets worse when breathing in or lying down.
 This is a painful, burning feeling behind the breastbone. It occurs when stomach acid washes up from the stomach into the tube that connects the throat to the stomach. That tube is called the esophagus.
 Problems with the esophagus can make swallowing difficult and even painful.
 Gallstones or inflammation of the gallbladder or pancreas can cause stomach pain that spreads to the chest.
 In this condition, the cartilage of the rib cage, particularly the cartilage that joins the ribs to the breastbone, becomes inflamed and painful.
 Chronic pain syndromes, such as fibromyalgia, may cause long-term pain that affects the chest muscles.
 A bruised or broken rib can cause chest pain.
 A blood clot that gets stuck in a lung artery can block blood flow to lung tissue.
 This condition causes chest pain that gets worse when you breathe in or cough.
 Chest pain due a collapsed lung typically begins suddenly. It can last for hours. It usually causes shortness of breath. A collapsed lung occurs when air leaks into the space between the lung and the ribs.
 This condition affects the arteries carrying blood to the lungs. It can cause chest pain.
 If you have periods of intense fear with chest pain, you may be having a panic attack. Panic attack symptoms also include a rapid heartbeat, rapid breathing, a lot of sweating, shortness of breath, nausea, dizziness and a fear of dying. It can be hard to tell the difference between a heart attack and a panic attack. Always seek medical help if you aren't sure of the cause of chest pain.
 This condition can cause intense pain and a band of blisters from the back around to the chest area.

 Environmental factors, including your family's beliefs and attitudes and exposure to a peer group that encourages drug use, seem to play a role in initial drug use.
 Once you've started using a drug, the development into addiction may be influenced by inherited (genetic) traits, which may delay or speed up the disease progression.
 Drug addiction is more common in some families and likely involves an increased risk based on genes. If you have a blood relative, such as a parent or sibling, with alcohol or drug addiction, you're at greater risk of developing a drug addiction.
 If you have a mental health disorder such as depression, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or post-traumatic stress disorder, you're more likely to become addicted to drugs. Using drugs can become a way of coping with painful feelings, such as anxiety, depression and loneliness, and can make these problems even worse.
 Peer pressure is a strong factor in starting to use and misuse drugs, particularly for young people.
 Difficult family situations or lack of a bond with your parents or siblings may increase the risk of addiction, as can a lack of parental supervision.
 Using drugs at an early age can cause changes in the developing brain and increase the likelihood of progressing to drug addiction.
 Some drugs, such as stimulants, cocaine or opioid painkillers, may result in faster development of addiction than other drugs. Smoking or injecting drugs can increase the potential for addiction. Taking drugs considered less addicting — so-called ""light drugs"" — can start you on a pathway of drug use and addiction.
Methamphetamine, opiates and cocaine are highly addictive and cause multiple short-term and long-term health consequences, including psychotic behavior, seizures or death due to overdose. Opioid drugs affect the part of the brain that controls breathing, and overdose can result in death. Taking opioids with alcohol increases this risk.
 and flunitrazepam may cause sedation, confusion and memory loss. These so-called ""date rape drugs"" are known to impair the ability to resist unwanted contact and recollection of the event. At high doses, they can cause seizures, coma and death. The danger increases when these drugs are taken with alcohol.
 — also known as molly or ecstasy — can interfere with the body's ability to regulate temperature. A severe spike in body temperature can result in liver, kidney or heart failure and death. Other complications can include severe dehydration, leading to seizures. Long-term, 
 can damage the brain. 
One particular danger of club drugs is that the liquid, pill or powder forms of these drugs available on the street often contain unknown substances that can be harmful, including other illegally manufactured or pharmaceutical drugs.
Due to the toxic nature of inhalants, users may develop brain damage of different levels of severity. Sudden death can occur even after a single exposure.
 People who are addicted to a drug are more likely to get an infectious disease, such as 
, either through unsafe sex or by sharing needles with others. 
 Drug addiction can lead to a range of both short-term and long-term mental and physical health problems. These depend on what drug is taken.
 People who are addicted to drugs are more likely to drive or do other dangerous activities while under the influence.
 People who are addicted to drugs die by suicide more often than people who aren't addicted.
 Behavioral changes may cause relationship or family conflict and custody issues.
 Drug use can cause declining performance at work, absenteeism and eventual loss of employment.
 Drug use can negatively affect academic performance and motivation to excel in school.
 Legal problems are common for drug users and can stem from buying or possessing illegal drugs, stealing to support the drug addiction, driving while under the influence of drugs or alcohol, or disputes over child custody.
 Spending money to support drug use takes away money from other needs, could lead to debt, and can lead to illegal or unethical behaviors.
 Talk to your children about the risks of drug use and misuse.
 Be a good listener when your children talk about peer pressure and be supportive of their efforts to resist it.
 Don't misuse alcohol or addictive drugs. Children of parents who misuse drugs are at greater risk of drug addiction.
 Work on your relationship with your children. A strong, stable bond between you and your child will reduce your child's risk of using or misusing drugs.
 Monitor your cravings. It may seem like you've recovered and you don't need to keep taking steps to stay drug-free. But your chances of staying drug-free will be much higher if you continue seeing your therapist or counselor, going to support group meetings and taking prescribed medicine.
 Don't go back to the neighborhood where you used to get your drugs. And stay away from your old drug crowd.
 If you start using the drug again, talk to your health care provider, your mental health provider or someone else who can help you right away.

Childhood obesity," Regularly eating high-calorie foods, such as fast foods, baked goods and vending machine snacks, can cause your child to gain weight. Candy and desserts also can cause weight gain, and more and more evidence points to sugary drinks, including fruit juices and sports drinks, as culprits in obesity in some people.
 Children who don't exercise much are more likely to gain weight because they don't burn as many calories. Too much time spent in sedentary activities, such as watching television or playing video games, also contributes to the problem. TV shows also often feature ads for unhealthy foods.
 If your child comes from a family of overweight people, he or she may be more likely to put on weight. This is especially true in an environment where high-calorie foods are always available and physical activity isn't encouraged.
 Personal, parental and family stress can increase a child's risk of obesity. Some children overeat to cope with problems or to deal with emotions, such as stress, or to fight boredom. Their parents might have similar tendencies.
 People in some communities have limited resources and limited access to supermarkets. As a result, they might buy convenience foods that don't spoil quickly, such as frozen meals, crackers and cookies. Also, people who live in lower income neighborhoods might not have access to a safe place to exercise.
 Some prescription drugs can increase the risk of developing obesity. They include prednisone, lithium, amitriptyline, paroxetine (Paxil), gabapentin (Neurontin, Gralise, Horizant) and propranolol (Inderal, Hemangeol).
 This chronic condition affects the way your child's body uses sugar (glucose). Obesity and a sedentary lifestyle increase the risk of type 2 diabetes.
 A poor diet can cause your child to develop one or both of these conditions. These factors can contribute to the buildup of plaques in the arteries, which can cause arteries to narrow and harden, possibly leading to a heart attack or stroke later in life.
 Extra weight causes extra stress on hips and knees. Childhood obesity can cause pain and sometimes injuries in the hips, knees and back.
 Asthma is more common in children who are overweight. These children are also more likely to develop obstructive sleep apnea, a potentially serious disorder in which a child's breathing repeatedly stops and starts during sleep.
 This disorder, which usually causes no symptoms, causes fatty deposits to build up in the liver. 
 can lead to scarring and liver damage.
 Make healthy eating and regular physical activity a family affair. Everyone will benefit and no one will feel singled out.
 Options include air-popped popcorn without butter, fruits with low-fat yogurt, baby carrots with hummus, or whole-grain cereal with low-fat milk.
 Don't be discouraged if your child doesn't immediately like a new food. It usually takes multiple exposures to a food to gain acceptance.
 Promising candy for good behavior is a bad idea.
 Some studies indicate that too little sleep may increase the risk of obesity. Sleep deprivation can cause hormonal imbalances that lead to increased appetite.

Cervicitis,"Large amounts of unusual vaginal discharge
Frequent, painful urination
Pain during sex
Bleeding between menstrual periods
Vaginal bleeding after sex, not associated with a menstrual period
Persistent, unusual vaginal discharge
Nonmenstrual vaginal bleeding
Pain during sex
 Most often, the bacterial and viral infections that cause cervicitis are transmitted by sexual contact. Cervicitis can result from common sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including gonorrhea, chlamydia, trichomoniasis and genital herpes.
 An allergy, either to contraceptive spermicides or to latex in condoms, may lead to cervicitis. A reaction to feminine hygiene products, such as douches or feminine deodorants, also can cause cervicitis.
 An overgrowth of some of the bacteria that are normally present in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) can lead to cervicitis.
Engage in high-risk sexual behavior, such as unprotected sex, sex with multiple partners or sex with someone who engages in high-risk behaviors
Began having sexual intercourse at an early age
Have a history of sexually transmitted infections
"
Stroke," A person having a stroke may be confused, slur words or may not be able to understand speech.
 This often affects just one side of the body. The person can try to raise both arms over the head. If one arm begins to fall, it may be a sign of a stroke. Also, one side of the mouth may droop when trying to smile.
 The person may suddenly have blurred or blackened vision in one or both eyes. Or the person may see double.
 A sudden, severe headache may be a symptom of a stroke. Vomiting, dizziness and a change in consciousness may occur with the headache.
 Someone having a stroke may stumble or lose balance or coordination.
 Ask the person to smile. Does one side of the face droop?
 Ask the person to raise both arms. Does one arm drift downward? Or is one arm unable to rise?
 Ask the person to repeat a simple phrase. Is the person's speech slurred or different from usual?
 If you see any of these signs, call 911 or emergency medical help right away.
High blood pressure that's not under control.
Overtreatment with blood thinners, also known as anticoagulants.

 infection.
 — People age 55 or older have a higher risk of stroke than do younger people.
 — African American and Hispanic people have a higher risk of stroke than do people of other races or ethnicities.
 — Men have a higher risk of stroke than do women. Women are usually older when they have strokes, and they're more likely to die of strokes than are men.
 — Taking birth control pills or hormone therapies that include estrogen can increase risk.
 You may become paralyzed on one side of the body. Or you may lose control of certain muscles, such as those on one side of the face or one arm.
 A stroke might affect the muscles in the mouth and throat. This can make it hard to talk clearly, swallow or eat. You also may have trouble with language, including speaking or understanding speech, reading or writing.
 Many people who have had strokes experience some memory loss. Others may have trouble thinking, reasoning, making judgments and understanding concepts.
 People who have had strokes may have more trouble controlling their emotions. Or they may develop depression.
 Pain, numbness or other feelings may occur in the parts of the body affected by stroke. If a stroke causes you to lose feeling in the left arm, you may develop a tingling sensation in that arm.
 People who have had strokes may become more withdrawn. They also may need help with grooming and daily chores.
 This is one of the most important things you can do to reduce your stroke risk. If you've had a stroke, lowering your blood pressure can help prevent a 
 or stroke in the future. Healthy lifestyle changes and medicines often are used to treat high blood pressure.
 Eating less cholesterol and fat, especially saturated fats and trans fats, may reduce buildup in the arteries. If you can't control your cholesterol through dietary changes alone, you may need a cholesterol-lowering medicine.
 Smoking raises the risk of stroke for smokers and nonsmokers exposed to secondhand smoke. Quitting lowers your risk of stroke.
 Diet, exercise and losing weight can help you keep your blood sugar in a healthy range. If lifestyle factors aren't enough to control blood sugar, you may be prescribed diabetes medicine.
 Being overweight contributes to other stroke risk factors, such as high blood pressure, cardiovascular disease and diabetes.
 Eating five or more servings of fruits or vegetables every day may reduce the risk of stroke. The Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes olive oil, fruit, nuts, vegetables and whole grains, may be helpful.
 Aerobic exercise reduces the risk of stroke in many ways. Exercise can lower blood pressure, increase the levels of good cholesterol, and improve the overall health of the blood vessels and heart. It also helps you lose weight, control diabetes and reduce stress. Gradually work up to at least 30 minutes of moderate physical activity on most or all days of the week. The American Heart association recommends getting 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity a week. Moderate intensity activities can include walking, jogging, swimming and bicycling.
 Drinking large amounts of alcohol increases the risk of high blood pressure, ischemic strokes and hemorrhagic strokes. Alcohol also may interact with other medicines you're taking. However, drinking small to moderate amounts of alcohol may help prevent ischemic stroke and decrease the blood's clotting tendency. A small to moderate amount is about one drink a day. Talk to your healthcare professional about what's appropriate for you.
 
 is a sleep disorder that causes you to stop breathing for short periods several times during sleep. Your healthcare professional may recommend a sleep study if you have symptoms of 
. Treatment includes a device that delivers positive airway pressure through a mask to keep the airway open while you sleep.
 Certain illicit drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are established risk factors for a 
 or a stroke.

 This common virus causes flu-like symptoms. If a mother has her first active infection during pregnancy, it can lead to birth defects.
 This viral infection can be prevented with a vaccine.
 This infection can be passed from mother to child during pregnancy, affecting the womb and placenta.
 This is a bacterial infection that's usually spread by sexual contact.
 This infection is caused by a parasite found in contaminated food, soil and the feces of infected cats.
 This infection is spread through mosquito bites and can affect the brain development of an unborn baby.
 This includes infections of the placenta or fetal membranes.
 One example is exposure to methyl mercury.
 Other conditions affecting the mother that can slightly increase the risk of cerebral palsy include thyroid conditions, preeclampsia or seizures.
 This bacterial infection causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
 This viral infection also causes swelling in the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord.
 Jaundice appears as a yellowing of the skin and eyes. The condition occurs when certain byproducts of ""used"" blood cells aren't filtered from the bloodstream.
 This condition is commonly caused by the baby having a stroke in the womb or in early infancy.
 Babies who weigh less than 5.5 pounds (2.5 kilograms) are at higher risk of developing cerebral palsy. This risk increases as birth weight drops.
 Cerebral palsy risk increases with the number of babies sharing the uterus. The risk also can be related to the likelihood of premature birth and low birth weight. If one or more of the babies die, the survivors' risk of cerebral palsy increases.
 Babies born prematurely are at higher risk of cerebral palsy. The earlier a baby is born, the greater the cerebral palsy risk.
 Events during labor and delivery may increase the risk of cerebral palsy.
 Contracture is muscle tissue shortening due to severe muscle tightening. This can be the result of spasticity. Contracture can slow bone growth, cause bones to bend, and result in joint changes, dislocation or partial dislocation. These can include a dislocated hip, a curved spine or other bone changes.
 Trouble with swallowing and feeding can make it hard to get enough nutrition, particularly for an infant. This can impair growth and weaken bones. Some children or adults need a feeding tube to get enough nutrition.
 People with cerebral palsy might have mental health conditions, such as depression. Social isolation and the challenges of coping with disabilities can contribute to depression. Behavior issues also can occur.
 People with cerebral palsy may develop heart disease, lung disease and breathing conditions. Trouble swallowing can result in respiratory issues, such as aspiration pneumonia. Aspiration pneumonia happens when a child inhales food, drink, saliva or vomit into the lungs.
 Pressure on joints or misalignment of joints from muscle spasticity may lead to this painful bone disease.
 Fractures due to low bone density can result from lack of mobility, poor nutrition and anti-seizure medicines.
 These can include sleep conditions, chronic pain, skin breakdown, intestinal issues and issues with oral health.
 Getting vaccinated against diseases such as rubella might prevent an infection. It's best to make sure you're fully vaccinated before getting pregnant.
 The healthier you are heading into a pregnancy, the less likely you'll be to develop an infection that results in cerebral palsy.
 See your health care professional regularly during pregnancy. Proper prenatal care can reduce health risks to you and your unborn baby. Seeing your health care professional regularly can help prevent premature birth, low birth weight and infections.
 These have been linked to cerebral palsy risk.

 Taking certain medicines such as opioids can cause breathing to become irregular or stop completely for a short time. These medicines can be taken by mouth or by shot, also called injection. They include morphine (MS Contin, Mitigo, others), oxycodone (Roxicodone, Oxycontin, others) and codeine.
 A Cheyne-Stokes breathing pattern can occur if you're at a very high altitude. The change in oxygen at a high altitude can cause fast breathing, known as hyperventilation, followed by taking in too little air.
 Some people with obstructive sleep apnea develop central sleep apnea while using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) for treatment. This condition is known as treatment-emergent central sleep apnea. It is a combination of obstructive and central sleep apneas.
 Several medical conditions, including end-stage kidney disease and stroke, may lead to central sleep apnea. This type of sleep apnea doesn't involve Cheyne-Stokes breathing.
 The cause of this uncommon type of central sleep apnea is not known.
 Males are more likely to develop central sleep apnea than are females.
 Central sleep apnea is more common among older adults, especially those older than age 60. This could be because people older than 60 are likely to have other medical conditions or sleep patterns that are linked to central sleep apnea.
 Heart problems put people at higher risk of central sleep apnea. An irregular heartbeat, known as atrial fibrillation, can increase the risk. Having heart muscles that don't pump enough blood for the body's needs, known as congestive heart failure, also can raise the risk.
 These brain conditions can affect the brain's ability to regulate breathing.
 Sleeping at an altitude higher than you're used to may increase your risk of sleep apnea. High-altitude sleep apnea resolves a few weeks after returning to a lower altitude.
 Opioid medicines may increase the risk of central sleep apnea.

 is an infection of the uterus and fallopian tubes that causes pelvic pain and fever. Severe infections might require hospitalization for intravenous antibiotics. 
 can damage the fallopian tubes, ovaries and uterus, including the cervix.
 A chlamydia infection can inflame the coiled tube located beside each testicle (epididymis). The infection can result in fever, scrotal pain and swelling.
 Rarely, the chlamydia organism can spread to the prostate gland. Prostatitis can cause pain during or after sex, fever and chills, painful urination, and lower back pain.
 The chlamydia infection can pass from the vaginal canal to your child during delivery, causing pneumonia or a serious eye infection.
 This occurs when a fertilized egg implants and grows outside of the uterus, usually in a fallopian tube. The pregnancy needs to be removed to prevent life-threatening complications, such as a burst tube. A chlamydia infection increases this risk.
 Chlamydia infections — even those that produce no signs or symptoms — can cause scarring and obstruction in the fallopian tubes, which might make women infertile.
 People who have Chlamydia trachomatis are at higher risk of developing reactive arthritis, also known as Reiter syndrome. This condition typically affects the joints, eyes and urethra — the tube that carries urine from your bladder to outside of your body.
 Use a male latex condom or a female polyurethane condom during each sexual contact. Condoms used properly during every sexual encounter reduce but don't eliminate the risk of infection.
 Having multiple sex partners puts you at a high risk of contracting chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections.
 If you're sexually active, particularly if you have multiple partners, talk with your doctor about how often you should be screened for chlamydia and other sexually transmitted infections.
 Douching decreases the number of good bacteria in the vagina, which can increase the risk of infection.

 In children, malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can lead to a softening of the bone, called osteomalacia or rickets. In adults, it can lead to a loss of bone density, called osteopenia or osteoporosis.
 Malabsorption of calcium and vitamin D can contribute to reproductive issues.
 Damage to your small intestine might cause you abdominal pain and diarrhea after eating or drinking dairy products that contain lactose. Once your intestine has healed, you might be able to tolerate dairy products again.
 People with celiac disease who don't maintain a gluten-free diet have a greater risk of developing several forms of cancer, including intestinal lymphoma and small bowel cancer.

Cavities and tooth decay,"Toothache and other pain.
Tooth sensitivity.
Mild to sharp pain when eating or drinking something sweet, hot or cold.
Holes or pits in your teeth that you can see.
Brown, black or white staining on any surface of a tooth.
Pain when you bite down.
 Dental plaque is a clear sticky film that coats your teeth. It's due to eating a lot of sugars and starches and not cleaning your teeth well. When you don't clean sugars and starches off your teeth, bacteria quickly begin feeding on them and forming plaque. Plaque that stays on your teeth can harden under or above your gumline into tartar. Tartar makes plaque harder to remove and creates a shield for bacteria. A dental professional needs to remove this plaque.
 The acids from bacteria remove minerals in your tooth's hard, outer enamel. This erosion causes tiny openings or holes in the enamel — the first stage of cavities. Once areas of enamel are worn away, the bacteria and acid can reach the next layer of your teeth, called dentin. This layer is softer than enamel and less resistant to acid, causing your teeth to be more sensitive.
 As tooth decay happens, the bacteria and acid move through your teeth to the inner tooth material (pulp) that contains nerves and blood vessels. The pulp becomes swollen and irritated from the bacteria. Because there is no place for the swelling to expand inside of a tooth, the nerve becomes pressed, causing pain. Sometimes pain and damage can spread outside of the tooth root to the bone, causing bone loss around the tooth and even reaching nearby teeth.
 Decay most often occurs in your back teeth — your molars and premolars. These teeth have lots of grooves, pits and crannies, and multiple roots that can collect food particles. That's why they're harder to keep clean than your smoother, easy-to-reach front teeth.
 Foods that cling to your teeth for a long time are more likely to cause decay than foods that are easily washed away by saliva. These foods include milk, ice cream, honey, sugar, soda, dried fruit, cake, cookies, hard candy and mints, dry cereal, and chips.
 When you snack or sip sugary drinks a lot, you give mouth bacteria more fuel to make acids that attack your teeth and wear them down. And sipping soda or other acidic drinks throughout the day helps create a continual acid bath over your teeth.
 When babies are given bedtime bottles filled with milk, formula, juice or other liquids that have sugar, these beverages remain on their teeth for hours while they sleep. This feeds bacteria that can cause decay. This damage often is called baby bottle tooth decay. Similar damage can occur when toddlers wander around drinking from a sippy cup filled with these beverages.
 If you don't clean your teeth soon after eating and drinking, plaque forms quickly, and the first stages of decay and gingivitis can begin.
 Fluoride, a naturally occurring mineral, helps prevent cavities. It also can reverse the earliest stages of tooth damage. Because of its benefits for teeth, fluoride is added to many public water supplies. It's also a common ingredient in toothpaste and mouth rinses. But bottled water usually does not contain fluoride.
 In the U.S., cavities are common in very young children and teenagers. Older adults also are at higher risk. Over time, teeth can wear down and gums may recede, making teeth more likely to decay. Older adults also may use more medicines that reduce saliva flow, raising the risk of tooth decay.
 Dry mouth is caused by a lack of saliva. Saliva helps prevent tooth decay by washing away food and plaque from your teeth. Substances found in saliva also help counter the acid produced by bacteria. Certain medicines, some medical conditions, radiation to your head or neck, or certain chemotherapy drugs can raise your risk of cavities by reducing saliva production.
 Over the years, dental fillings can weaken, begin to break down or get rough edges. This allows plaque to build up more easily and makes it harder to remove. Dental devices can stop fitting well, allowing decay to begin under them.
 Heartburn, a common symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), can cause stomach acid to flow into your mouth. This is called reflux. It can wear away the enamel of your teeth and cause a lot of damage. This exposes more of the dentin to bacteria, creating tooth decay. Your dentist may recommend that you talk with your healthcare professional to see if GERD is causing your enamel loss.
 Anorexia and bulimia can lead to a lot of tooth erosion and cavities. Stomach acid from repeated vomiting, called purging, washes over the teeth and begins eating away at the enamel. Eating disorders also can get in the way of saliva production.
Pain.
Abscess — a bacterial infection that causes a pocket of pus to form in a tooth.
Swelling or pus around a tooth.

In rare cases, a tooth abscess, which can lead to more-serious or even life-threatening infections.
 Brush your teeth at least twice a day, and ideally after every meal, using toothpaste with fluoride. To clean between your teeth, floss or use an interdental cleaner. This cleaner helps reach areas where a toothbrush can't reach.
 If your dentist feels that you have a high risk of getting cavities, a mouth rinse with fluoride may be recommended.
 Get professional teeth cleanings and regular oral exams, which can help prevent problems or spot them early. Your dentist can recommend a schedule that's best for you.
 A sealant is a protective plastic coating applied to the chewing surface of back teeth. It seals off grooves and crannies that tend to collect food, protecting tooth enamel from plaque and acid. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends sealants for all school-age children. Sealants may last for several years before they need to be replaced, but they need to be checked regularly.
 Most public water supplies have added fluoride, which can reduce tooth decay greatly. If you drink only bottled water that doesn't contain fluoride, you'll miss out on the benefits of fluoride.
 Whenever you eat or drink beverages other than water, you help your mouth bacteria create acids that can destroy tooth enamel. If you snack or drink throughout the day, your teeth are under constant attack.
 Some foods and beverages are better for your teeth than others. Avoid foods that get stuck in grooves and pits of your teeth for long periods, or brush soon after eating them. Foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables increase saliva flow, and unsweetened coffee, tea and sugar-free gum help wash away food particles.
 Your dentist may recommend periodic fluoride treatments, especially if you aren't getting enough fluoride through fluoridated drinking water and other sources. Your dentist also may recommend custom trays that fit over your teeth to apply prescription fluoride if your risk of tooth decay is very high.
 If tooth decay is likely — for example, because of a medical condition — your dentist may recommend special antiseptic and disinfecting mouth rinses like chlorhexidine or other treatments to cut down on harmful bacteria in your mouth. Unless your dentist tells you otherwise, mouth rinses, also called mouthwash, generally are not recommended for children younger than the age of 6 so they don't swallow too much of it.
 Chewing sugar-free gum along with prescription fluoride and an antibacterial rinse can help reduce the risk of cavities. But in some people, xylitol, which is often found in sugar-free gum or sugar-free candies, may cause gas or diarrhea if consumed in large amounts.

 A nuclear cataract may at first cause objects far away to be blurry but objects up close to look clear. A nuclear cataract may even improve your reading vision for a short time. But with time, the lens slowly turns more yellow or brown and makes your vision worse. It may become difficult to tell colors apart.
 A cortical cataract begins as white, wedge-shaped spots or streaks on the outer edge of the lens cortex. As the cataract slowly grows, the streaks spread to the center and affect light passing through the lens.
 A posterior subcapsular cataract starts as a small spot that usually forms near the back of the lens, right in the path of light. A posterior subcapsular cataract often affects your reading vision. It also may reduce your vision in bright light and cause glare or halos around lights at night. These types of cataracts tend to grow faster than others.

Carpal tunnel syndrome,"
    

    

    

    
 You may experience weakness in the hand and drop objects. This may be due to the numbness in the hand or weakness of the thumb's pinching muscles, which are also controlled by the median nerve.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 Some chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, increase the risk of nerve damage, including damage to the median nerve.
 Rheumatoid arthritis and other conditions that have an inflammatory component can affect the lining around the tendons in the wrist and put pressure on the median nerve.
 Some studies have shown a link between carpal tunnel syndrome and the use of anastrozole (Arimidex), a drug used to treat breast cancer.
 Being obese is a risk factor for carpal tunnel syndrome.
 Fluid retention may increase the pressure within the carpal tunnel, irritating the median nerve. This is common during pregnancy and menopause. Carpal tunnel syndrome associated with pregnancy generally gets better on its own after pregnancy.
 Certain conditions, such as menopause, thyroid disorders, kidney failure and lymphedema, may increase the chances of carpal tunnel syndrome.

    

    

    

    
 If your work involves a cash register or keyboard, for instance, hit the keys softly. For prolonged handwriting, use a big pen with an oversized, soft grip adapter and free-flowing ink.
 Gently stretch and bend hands and wrists periodically. Alternate tasks when possible. This is especially important if you use equipment that vibrates or that requires you to exert a great amount of force. Even a few minutes each hour can make a difference.
 Avoid bending your wrist all the way up or down. A relaxed middle position is best. Keep your keyboard at elbow height or slightly lower.
 Incorrect posture rolls shoulders forward, shortening the neck and shoulder muscles and compressing nerves in the neck. This can affect the wrists, fingers and hands, and can cause neck pain.
 Make sure that your computer mouse is comfortable and doesn't strain your wrist.
 You're more likely to develop hand pain and stiffness if you work in a cold environment. If you can't control the temperature at work, put on fingerless gloves that keep the hands and wrists warm.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,"Chest pain, especially during exercise
Fainting, especially during or just after exercise or exertion
Heart murmur, which a health care provider might detect while listening to the heart
Sensation of fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeats (palpitations)
Shortness of breath, especially during exercise
Rapid or irregular heartbeat
Difficulty breathing
Chest pain
 A thickened heart muscle and changes in the structure of heart cells can cause changes in the heart's electrical system, resulting in fast or irregular heartbeats. Atrial fibrillation can also increase the risk of developing blood clots, which can travel to the brain and cause a stroke.
 In many people, the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart, causing shortness of breath with exertion, chest pain, dizziness and fainting spells.
 If the thickened heart muscle blocks the blood flow leaving the heart, the valve between the left atrium and left ventricle (mitral valve) might not close properly. As a result, blood can leak backward into the left atrium (mitral valve regurgitation), possibly making symptoms worse.
 In a small number of people with 
, the thickened heart muscle becomes weak and ineffective. The ventricle becomes enlarged (dilated), and it pumps less forcefully.
 The thickened heart muscle can eventually become too stiff to fill the heart with blood. As a result, the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
 An irregular heartbeat or blockage of blood flow can sometimes cause fainting. Unexplained fainting can be related to sudden cardiac death, especially if it's happened recently and in a young person.
 Rarely, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy can cause heart-related sudden death in people of all ages. Because many people with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy don't realize they have it, sudden cardiac death might be the first sign of the condition. It can happen in seemingly healthy young people, including high school athletes and other young, active adults.

The heart is divided into chambers — two upper chambers (atria) and two lower chambers (ventricles).
The right side of the heart moves blood to the lungs through blood vessels (pulmonary arteries).
In the lungs, blood picks up oxygen and then returns to the left side of the heart through the pulmonary veins.
The left side of the heart then pumps the blood through the aorta and out to the rest of the body.
During contraction (systole), the lower heart chambers (ventricles) squeeze tight. This action forces blood to the lungs and the rest of the body.
During relaxation (diastole), the ventricles fill with blood from the upper heart chambers (atria).
Electrical signals start in the upper right chamber (right atrium).
The signals travel through specialized pathways to the lower heart chambers (ventricles). This tells the heart to pump.
Cardiomyopathy
Coronary artery disease
Diabetes
Drug misuse
Emotional stress
Excessive use of alcohol or caffeine
Heart problem present at birth (congenital heart defects)

Use of certain medications, including those bought without a prescription, and herbs and supplements
 The cause of this most common type of cardiomyopathy often is unknown. It may be passed down through families (inherited). Dilated cardiomyopathy typically starts in the heart's main pumping chamber (left ventricle). Many things can cause damage to the left ventricle, including heart attacks, infections, toxins and some drugs, including cancer medicines.
 This type is usually passed down through families (inherited).
 This is the least common type of cardiomyopathy. It can occur for no known reason. Sometimes it's caused by a buildup of protein called amyloid in the heart (cardiac amyloidosis) or connective tissue disorders.
Bacteria
Viruses
Parasites
Rheumatic fever
Infections (infectious endocarditis)
Connective tissue disorders
 Growing older increases the risk of damaged and narrowed arteries and a weakened or thickened heart muscle.
 Men are generally at greater risk of heart disease. The risk for women increases after menopause.
 A family history of heart disease increases the risk of coronary artery disease, especially if a parent developed it at an early age (before age 55 for a male relative, such as your brother or father, and 65 for a female relative, such as your mother or sister).
 If you smoke, quit. Substances in tobacco smoke damage the arteries. Heart attacks are more common in smokers than in nonsmokers. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that can help.
 Diets high in fat, salt, sugar and cholesterol have been linked to heart disease.
 Uncontrolled high blood pressure can cause the arteries to become hard and thick. These changes interrupt blood flow to the heart and body.
 Having high cholesterol increases the risk of atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis has been linked to heart attacks and strokes.
 Diabetes increases the risk of heart disease. Obesity and high blood pressure increase the risk of diabetes and heart disease.
 Excess weight typically worsens other heart disease risk factors.
 Being inactive (sedentary lifestyle) is associated with many forms of heart disease and some of its risk factors, too.
 Unrelieved stress may damage the arteries and worsen other risk factors for heart disease.
 It's important to brush and floss your teeth and gums often. Also get regular dental checkups. Unhealthy teeth and gums makes it easier for germs to enter the bloodstream and travel to the heart. This can cause endocarditis.
 This is one of the most common complications of heart disease. Heart failure occurs when the heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs.
 A heart attack may occur if a blood clot is stuck in a blood vessel that goes to the heart.
 The risk factors that lead to heart disease can also lead to an ischemic stroke. This type of stroke happens when the arteries to the brain are narrowed or blocked. Too little blood reaches the brain. A stroke is a medical emergency — brain tissue begins to die within just a few minutes of a stroke.
 An aneurysm is a bulge in the wall of an artery. If an aneurysm bursts, you may have life-threatening internal bleeding.
 In this condition, the arms or legs — usually the legs — don't get enough blood. This causes symptoms, most notably leg pain when walking (claudication). Atherosclerosis can lead to peripheral artery disease.
 Sudden cardiac arrest is the sudden loss of heart function, breathing and consciousness. It's usually due to a problem with the heart's electrical system. Sudden cardiac arrest is a medical emergency. If not treated immediately, it results in sudden cardiac death.

 The heart can't pump enough blood to meet the body's needs. Untreated, heart failure can be life-threatening.
 Because the heart can't pump effectively, blood clots might form in the heart. If clots enter the bloodstream, they can block the blood flow to other organs, including the heart and brain.
 Because cardiomyopathy causes the heart to enlarge, the heart valves might not close properly. This can cause blood to flow backward in the valve.
 Cardiomyopathy can trigger irregular heart rhythms that cause fainting or, in some cases, sudden death if the heart stops beating effectively.

 Sudden cardiac arrest may occur if the heart arteries become clogged with cholesterol and other deposits, reducing blood flow to the heart.
 If a heart attack occurs, often as a result of severe coronary artery disease, it can trigger ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac arrest. Also, a heart attack can leave scar tissue in the heart. The scar tissue can cause changes in the heartbeat.
 This condition usually happens when the walls in the heart muscle stretch. The heart muscle gets bigger or thicker.
 Leaking or narrowing of the heart valves can lead to stretching or thickening of the heart muscle. When the chambers become enlarged or weakened because of stress caused by a tight or leaking valve, there's an increased risk of developing a heart rhythm problem.
 Sudden cardiac arrest in children or adolescents is often due to a heart problem that they're born with. Adults who've had repair surgery for a congenital heart defect also have an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest.
 Conditions such as long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome cause the heart to beat in an unorganized way. If the heart rhythm isn't quickly restored, sudden death can occur. Young people with

 Hemihypertrophy (hem-e-hi-PUR-truh-fee) means one side of the body or a part of the body is larger than the other side.
 This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, aniridia, genital and urinary system problems, and intellectual disabilities.
 This syndrome includes Wilms tumor, kidney disease and male pseudohermaphroditism (soo-do-her-MAF-roe-dit-iz-um). In male pseudohermaphroditism, a boy's genitals aren't clearly male.
 Children with this syndrome tend to be much larger than what is typical, known as macrosomia. This syndrome might cause organs in the stomach area to jut into the base of the umbilical cord, a large tongue, large internal organs and ears that are formed unusually.

Vulvar cancer,"Itching that doesn't go away
Pain and tenderness
Bleeding that isn't from menstruation
Skin changes, such as color changes or thickening
A lump, wartlike bumps or an open sore (ulcer)
 This cancer begins in the thin, flat cells that line the surface of the vulva. Most vulvar cancers are squamous cell carcinomas.
 This cancer begins in the pigment-producing cells found in the skin of the vulva.
 The risk of vulvar cancer increases with age, though it can occur at any age. The average age at diagnosis is 65.
 
 is a sexually transmitted infection that increases the risk of several cancers, including vulvar cancer and cervical cancer. Many young, sexually active people are exposed to 
, but for most the infection goes away on its own. For some, the infection causes cell changes and increases the risk of cancer in the future.
 Smoking increases the risk of vulvar cancer.
 People who take medications to suppress the immune system, such as those who've undergone organ transplant, and those with conditions that weaken the immune system, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), have an increased risk of vulvar cancer.
 Vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia is a precancerous condition that increases the risk of vulvar cancer. Most instances of vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia will never develop into cancer, but a small number do go on to become invasive vulvar cancer. For this reason, your doctor may recommend treatment to remove the area of abnormal cells and periodic follow-up checks.
 Lichen sclerosus, which causes the vulvar skin to become thin and itchy, increases the risk of vulvar cancer.
 Condoms may reduce your risk of contracting 
 but can't fully protect against it.
 Children and young adults may consider the 
 vaccine, which protects against the strains of the virus that are thought to cause the most cases of vulvar cancer.

 If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Stopping smoking can be very difficult, so get some help. Your doctor can discuss the benefits and risks of the many stop-smoking strategies, such as medication, nicotine replacement products and counseling.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
 The vitamins and antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may reduce your risk of throat cancer. Eat a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables.
 Some throat cancers are thought to be caused by the sexually transmitted infection human papillomavirus (HPV). You can reduce your risk of 
 by limiting your number of sexual partners and using a condom every time you have sex. Ask your doctor about the 
 vaccine, which may reduce the risk of throat cancer and other 
-related cancers.

 Merkel cell carcinoma causes firm, shiny nodules that occur on or just beneath the skin and in hair follicles. Merkel cell carcinoma is most often found on the head, neck and trunk.
 This uncommon and aggressive cancer originates in the oil glands in the skin. Sebaceous gland carcinomas — which usually appear as hard, painless nodules — can develop anywhere, but most occur on the eyelid, where they're frequently mistaken for other eyelid problems.
 lie just below the outer surface and function as the skin's inner lining.
 which produce new skin cells, sit beneath the squamous cells.
 — which produce melanin, the pigment that gives skin its normal color — are located in the lower part of your epidermis. Melanocytes produce more melanin when you're in the sun to help protect the deeper layers of your skin.
 Anyone, regardless of skin color, can get skin cancer. However, having less pigment (melanin) in your skin provides less protection from damaging UV radiation. If you have blond or red hair and light-colored eyes, and you freckle or sunburn easily, you're much more likely to develop skin cancer than is a person with darker skin.
 Having had one or more blistering sunburns as a child or teenager increases your risk of developing skin cancer as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor.
 Anyone who spends considerable time in the sun may develop skin cancer, especially if the skin isn't protected by sunscreen or clothing. Tanning, including exposure to tanning lamps and beds, also puts you at risk. A tan is your skin's injury response to excessive UV radiation.
 People who live in sunny, warm climates are exposed to more sunlight than are people who live in colder climates. Living at higher elevations, where the sunlight is strongest, also exposes you to more radiation.
 People who have many moles or abnormal moles called dysplastic nevi are at increased risk of skin cancer. These abnormal moles — which look irregular and are generally larger than normal moles — are more likely than others to become cancerous. If you have a history of abnormal moles, watch them regularly for changes.
 Having skin lesions known as actinic keratoses can increase your risk of developing skin cancer. These precancerous skin growths typically appear as rough, scaly patches that range in color from brown to dark pink. They're most common on the face, head and hands of fair-skinned people whose skin has been sun damaged.
 If one of your parents or a sibling has had skin cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
 If you developed skin cancer once, you're at risk of developing it again.
 People with weakened immune systems have a greater risk of developing skin cancer. This includes people living with HIV/AIDS and those taking immunosuppressant drugs after an organ transplant.
 People who received radiation treatment for skin conditions such as eczema and acne may have an increased risk of skin cancer, particularly basal cell carcinoma.
 Exposure to certain substances, such as arsenic, may increase your risk of skin cancer.
















 Lights used in tanning beds emit UV rays and can increase your risk of skin cancer.

A new sore or raised area on an old scar or sore.
A rough, scaly patch on the lip that may become an open sore.
A sore or rough patch inside the mouth.
A raised patch or wartlike sore on or in the anus or on the genitals.

    

    

    
 
 radiation from the sun increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Covering the skin with clothes or sunblock can help lower the risk.
 People who use indoor tanning beds have an increased risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
 Having had one or more sunburns that raised blisters as a child or teenager increases the risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the skin as an adult. Sunburns in adulthood also are a risk factor.
 Some types of skin sores can turn into skin cancer. Examples are actinic keratosis or Bowen disease.  Having one of these conditions increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.
 People who've had squamous cell carcinoma of the skin once are much more likely to get it again.
 People with weakened immune systems have an increased risk of skin cancer. This includes people who have leukemia or lymphoma. And it includes those who take medicines to control the immune system, such as those who have had organ transplants.
 People with xeroderma pigmentosum, which causes great sensitivity to sunlight, have a greatly increased risk of developing skin cancer.
 This common infection that's passed through sexual contact increases the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.
 Squamous cell carcinoma of the skin can form in scars, burns and sores that don't heal.
Grows very large or deep.
Involves the mucous membranes, such as the lips.
Occurs in a person with a weakened immune system. Examples of things that might cause a weakened immune system include having chronic leukemia or taking medicine to control the immune system after an organ transplant.
 For much of North America, the sun's rays are strongest between about 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Plan outdoor activities at other times of the day, even during winter or when the sky is cloudy. When outside, stay in shade as much as possible.
 Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an 
 of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously. Apply again every two hours, or more often if you're swimming or sweating.
 Wear dark, tightly woven clothes that cover arms and legs. Wear a wide-brimmed hat that shades your face and ears. Don't forget sunglasses. Look for those that block both types of 
 radiation, 
 and 
 rays.
 The lights in tanning beds give off 
 radiation. Using tanning beds increases the risk of skin cancer.

Prostate cancer,"Trouble urinating
Decreased force in the stream of urine
Blood in the urine
Blood in the semen
Bone pain
Losing weight without trying
Erectile dysfunction
 Your risk of prostate cancer increases as you age. It's most common after age 50.
 For reasons not yet determined, Black people have a greater risk of prostate cancer than do people of other races. In Black people, prostate cancer is also more likely to be aggressive or advanced.
 If a blood relative, such as a parent, sibling or child, has been diagnosed with prostate cancer, your risk may be increased. Also, if you have a family history of genes that increase the risk of breast cancer (BRCA1 or BRCA2) or a very strong family history of breast cancer, your risk of prostate cancer may be higher.
 People who are obese may have a higher risk of prostate cancer compared with people considered to have a healthy weight, though studies have had mixed results. In obese people, the cancer is more likely to be more aggressive and more likely to return after initial treatment.
 Prostate cancer can spread to nearby organs, such as your bladder, or travel through your bloodstream or lymphatic system to your bones or other organs. Prostate cancer that spreads to the bones can cause pain and broken bones. Once prostate cancer has spread to other areas of the body, it may still respond to treatment and may be controlled, but it's unlikely to be cured.
 Both prostate cancer and its treatment can cause urinary incontinence. Treatment for incontinence depends on the type you have, how severe it is and the likelihood it will improve over time. Treatment options may include medications, catheters and surgery.
 Erectile dysfunction can result from prostate cancer or its treatment, including surgery, radiation or hormone treatments. Medications, vacuum devices that assist in achieving erection and surgery are available to treat erectile dysfunction.

    

    

    
 No studies have shown that supplements play a role in reducing your risk of prostate cancer. Instead, choose foods that are rich in vitamins and minerals so that you can maintain healthy levels of vitamins in your body.
 Exercise improves your overall health, helps you maintain your weight and improves your mood. Try to exercise most days of the week. If you're new to exercise, start slow and work your way up to more exercise time each day.
 If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain it by choosing a healthy diet and exercising most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, add more exercise and reduce the number of calories you eat each day. Ask your doctor for help creating a plan for healthy weight loss.

 B cells are a type of lymphocyte that fights infection by producing antibodies to neutralize foreign invaders. Most non-Hodgkin's lymphoma arises from B cells. Subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that involve B cells include diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, follicular lymphoma, mantle cell lymphoma and Burkitt lymphoma.
 T cells are a type of lymphocyte that's involved in killing foreign invaders directly. Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma occurs much less often in T cells. Subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that involve T cells include peripheral T-cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.
 If you've had an organ transplant and take medicines that control your immune system, you might have an increased risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Certain viral and bacterial infections appear to increase the risk of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Viruses linked to this type of cancer include 
 and Epstein-Barr infection. Bacteria linked to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma include the ulcer-causing Helicobacter pylori.
 Certain chemicals, such as those used to kill insects and weeds, may increase your risk of developing non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. More research is needed to understand the possible link between pesticides and the development of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
 Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma can occur at any age, but the risk increases with age. It's most common in people 60 or over.

 Small cell lung cancer occurs almost exclusively in heavy smokers and is less common than non-small cell lung cancer.
 Non-small cell lung cancer is an umbrella term for several types of lung cancers. Non-small cell lung cancers include squamous cell carcinoma, adenocarcinoma and large cell carcinoma.
 Your risk of lung cancer increases with the number of cigarettes you smoke each day and the number of years you have smoked. Quitting at any age can significantly lower your risk of developing lung cancer.
 Even if you don't smoke, your risk of lung cancer increases if you're exposed to secondhand smoke.
 If you've undergone radiation therapy to the chest for another type of cancer, you may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer.
 Radon is produced by the natural breakdown of uranium in soil, rock and water that eventually becomes part of the air you breathe. Unsafe levels of radon can accumulate in any building, including homes.
 Workplace exposure to asbestos and other substances known to cause cancer — such as arsenic, chromium and nickel — can increase your risk of developing lung cancer, especially if you're a smoker.
 People with a parent, sibling or child with lung cancer have an increased risk of the disease.
 People with lung cancer can experience shortness of breath if cancer grows to block the major airways. Lung cancer can also cause fluid to accumulate around the lungs, making it harder for the affected lung to expand fully when you inhale.
 Lung cancer can cause bleeding in the airway, which can cause you to cough up blood (hemoptysis). Sometimes bleeding can become severe. Treatments are available to control bleeding.
 Advanced lung cancer that spreads to the lining of a lung or to another area of the body, such as a bone, can cause pain. Tell your doctor if you experience pain, as many treatments are available to control pain.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 If you've never smoked, don't start. Talk to your children about not smoking so that they can understand how to avoid this major risk factor for lung cancer. Begin conversations about the dangers of smoking with your children early so that they know how to react to peer pressure.
 Stop smoking now. Quitting reduces your risk of lung cancer, even if you've smoked for years. Talk to your doctor about strategies and stop-smoking aids that can help you quit. Options include nicotine replacement products, medications and support groups.
 If you live or work with a smoker, urge him or her to quit. At the very least, ask him or her to smoke outside. Avoid areas where people smoke, such as bars and restaurants, and seek out smoke-free options.
 Have the radon levels in your home checked, especially if you live in an area where radon is known to be a problem. High radon levels can be remedied to make your home safer. For information on radon testing, contact your local department of public health or a local chapter of the American Lung Association.
 Take precautions to protect yourself from exposure to toxic chemicals at work. Follow your employer's precautions. For instance, if you're given a face mask for protection, always wear it. Ask your doctor what more you can do to protect yourself at work. Your risk of lung damage from workplace carcinogens increases if you smoke.
 Choose a healthy diet with a variety of fruits and vegetables. Food sources of vitamins and nutrients are best. Avoid taking large doses of vitamins in pill form, as they may be harmful. For instance, researchers hoping to reduce the risk of lung cancer in heavy smokers gave them beta carotene supplements. Results showed the supplements actually increased the risk of cancer in smokers.
 If you don't exercise regularly, start out slowly. Try to exercise most days of the week.

 Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers. People with Lynch syndrome tend to develop colon cancer before age 50.
 
 is a rare disorder that causes thousands of polyps in the lining of your colon and rectum. People with untreated 
 have a significantly increased risk of developing colon or rectal cancer before age 40.
 Colorectal cancer can be diagnosed at any age, but most people with this type of cancer are older than 50. The rates of colorectal cancer in people younger than 50 have been increasing, but doctors aren't sure why.
 People of African ancestry born in the United States have a greater risk of colorectal cancer than do people of European ancestry.
 Your risk of colorectal cancer is higher if you've already had rectal cancer, colon cancer or adenomatous polyps.
 Chronic inflammatory diseases of the colon and rectum, such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, increase your risk of colorectal cancer.
 Genetic syndromes passed through generations of your family can increase your risk of colon and rectal cancer, including 
 and Lynch syndrome.
 You're more likely to develop colorectal cancer if you have a parent, sibling or child with colon or rectal cancer.
 Colorectal cancer may be associated with a diet low in vegetables and high in red meat, particularly when the meat is charred or well done.
 If you're inactive, you're more likely to develop colorectal cancer. Getting regular physical activity may reduce your risk of cancer.
 People with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
 Obese people have an increased risk of colorectal cancer when compared with people considered at a healthy weight.
 People who smoke may have an increased risk of colorectal cancer.
 Regularly drinking more than three alcoholic beverages a week may increase your risk of colorectal cancer.
 Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers may increase the risk of colorectal cancer.

    

    

    
 Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk to your doctor before beginning any exercise program.
 Fruits, vegetables and whole grains contain vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may play a role in cancer prevention. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get an array of vitamins and nutrients.
 If you're at a healthy weight, maintain it by exercising regularly and choosing a healthy diet. If you're overweight, work to lose weight slowly by increasing exercise and reducing the number of calories you eat.
 If you smoke, stop. If you're having trouble quitting, talk to your doctor about options. Medications and counseling may help.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.

 Chronic infection with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV) increases your risk of liver cancer.
 This progressive and irreversible condition causes scar tissue to form in your liver and increases your chances of developing liver cancer.
 Liver diseases that can increase the risk of liver cancer include hemochromatosis and Wilson's disease.
 People with this blood sugar disorder have a greater risk of liver cancer than those who don't have diabetes.
 An accumulation of fat in the liver increases the risk of liver cancer.
 Aflatoxins are poisons produced by molds that grow on crops that are stored poorly. Crops, such as grains and nuts, can become contaminated with aflatoxins, which can end up in foods made of these products.
 Consuming more than a moderate amount of alcohol daily over many years can lead to irreversible liver damage and increase your risk of liver cancer.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink. For women, this means no more than one drink a day. For men, this means no more than two drinks a day.
 If your current weight is healthy, work to maintain it by choosing a healthy diet and exercising most days of the week. If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase the amount of exercise you do. Aim to lose weight slowly — 1 or 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilograms) each week.
 Don't engage in unprotected sex unless you're certain your partner isn't infected with 
, 
 or any other sexually transmitted infection. If you don't know the health status of your partner, use a condom every time you have sexual intercourse.
 Reduce your risk of 
 by not injecting illegal drugs. But if that isn't an option for you, make sure any needle you use is sterile, and don't share it. Contaminated drug paraphernalia is a common cause of hepatitis C infection. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community and consider seeking help for your drug use.
 Needles that may not be properly sterilized can spread the hepatitis C virus. Before getting a piercing or tattoo, check out the shops in your area and ask staff members about their safety practices. If employees at a shop refuse to answer your questions or don't take your questions seriously, take that as a sign that the facility isn't right for you.

 In acute leukemia, the abnormal blood cells are immature blood cells (blasts). They can't carry out their normal functions, and they multiply rapidly, so the disease worsens quickly. Acute leukemia requires aggressive, timely treatment.
 There are many types of chronic leukemias. Some produce too many cells and some cause too few cells to be produced. Chronic leukemia involves more-mature blood cells. These blood cells replicate or accumulate more slowly and can function normally for a period of time. Some forms of chronic leukemia initially produce no early symptoms and can go unnoticed or undiagnosed for years.
 This type of leukemia affects the lymphoid cells (lymphocytes), which form lymphoid or lymphatic tissue. Lymphatic tissue makes up your immune system.
 This type of leukemia affects the myeloid cells. Myeloid cells give rise to red blood cells, white blood cells and platelet-producing cells.
 This is the most common type of leukemia in young children. 
 can also occur in adults.

 With 
, the most common chronic adult leukemia, you may feel well for years without needing treatment.
 This type of leukemia mainly affects adults. A person with 
 may have few or no symptoms for months or years before entering a phase in which the leukemia cells grow more quickly.
 Other, rarer types of leukemia exist, including hairy cell leukemia, myelodysplastic syndromes and myeloproliferative disorders.
 People who've had certain types of chemotherapy and radiation therapy for other cancers have an increased risk of developing certain types of leukemia.
 Genetic abnormalities seem to play a role in the development of leukemia. Certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome, are associated with an increased risk of leukemia.
 Exposure to certain chemicals, such as benzene — which is found in gasoline and is used by the chemical industry — is linked to an increased risk of some kinds of leukemia.
 Smoking cigarettes increases the risk of acute myelogenous leukemia.
 If members of your family have been diagnosed with leukemia, your risk of the disease may be increased.

Thyroid cancer,"A lump (nodule) that can be felt through the skin on your neck
A feeling that close-fitting shirt collars are becoming too tight
Changes to your voice, including increasing hoarseness
Difficulty swallowing
Swollen lymph nodes in your neck
Pain in your neck and throat
 This broad category includes types of thyroid cancer that start in the cells that produce and store thyroid hormones. These cells are called follicular cells. Differentiated thyroid cancers cells appear similar to healthy cells when viewed under a microscope.
    

    
 This rare type of thyroid cancer grows quickly and can be difficult to treat. However, treatments can help slow the progression of the disease. Anaplastic thyroid cancer tends to occur in people older than 60. It can cause severe signs and symptoms, such as neck swelling that worsens very quickly and may lead to difficulty breathing and swallowing.
 This rare type of thyroid cancer begins in thyroid cells called C cells, which produce the hormone calcitonin. Elevated levels of calcitonin in the blood can indicate medullary thyroid cancer at a very early stage. Some medullary thyroid cancers are caused by a gene called 
 that's passed from parents to children. Changes in the 
 gene can cause familial medullary thyroid cancer and multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2. Familial medullary thyroid cancer increases the risk of thyroid cancer. Multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 2, increases the risk of thyroid cancer, adrenal gland cancer and other types of cancers.
 Other very rare types of cancer can start in the thyroid. These include thyroid lymphoma, which begins in the immune system cells of the thyroid, and thyroid sarcoma, which begins in the connective tissue cells of the thyroid.
 Thyroid cancer occurs more often in women than in men. Experts think it may be related to the hormone estrogen. People who are assigned female sex at birth generally have higher levels of estrogen in their bodies.
 Radiation therapy treatments to the head and neck increase the risk of thyroid cancer.
 Genetic syndromes that increase the risk of thyroid cancer include familial medullary thyroid cancer, multiple endocrine neoplasia, Cowden syndrome and familial adenomatous polyposis. Types of thyroid cancer that sometimes run in families include medullary thyroid cancer and papillary thyroid cancer.

 Hairy cell leukemia can happen at any age. But most people diagnosed with hairy cell leukemia are in their 50s or 60s. It's rare in children.
 Hairy cell leukemia can happen to anyone. But it's more likely in males.
 Your body needs healthy white blood cells to fight off germs. If your body can't make enough healthy white blood cells, you might get more infections.
 Your body needs healthy platelet cells to control bleeding. If the number of platelets in your blood is low, you might notice that you bruise more easily. You might also have bleeding from the nose or gums.
 Your body needs healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen through your body. Having too few red blood cells is called anemia. Anemia can make you feel very tired.

 Colon cancer can happen at any age. But most people with colon cancer are older than 50. The numbers of people younger than 50 who have colon cancer has been growing. Doctors don't know why.
 Black people in the United States have a greater risk of colon cancer than do people of other races.
 Having had colon cancer or colon polyps increases the risk of colon cancer.
 Conditions that cause pain and swelling of the intestines, called inflammatory bowel diseases, can increase the risk of colon cancer. These conditions include ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease.
 Some DNA changes that increase the risk of colon cancer run in families. The most common inherited syndromes that increase colon cancer risk are familial adenomatous polyposis and Lynch syndrome.
 Having a blood relative who has colon cancer increases the risk of getting colon cancer. Having more than one family member who has colon cancer or rectal cancer increases the risk more.
 Colon cancer and rectal cancer might be linked with a typical Western diet. This type of diet tends to be low in fiber and high in fat and calories. Research in this area has had mixed results. Some studies have found an increased risk of colon cancer in people who eat a lot of red meat and processed meat.
 People who are not active are more likely to develop colon cancer. Getting regular physical activity might help lower the risk.
 People with diabetes or insulin resistance have an increased risk of colon cancer.
 People who are obese have an increased risk of colon cancer. Obesity also increases the risk of dying of colon cancer.
 People who smoke can have an increased risk of colon cancer.
 Drinking too much alcohol can increase the risk of colon cancer.
 Radiation therapy directed at the abdomen to treat previous cancers increases the risk of colon cancer.
 Fruits, vegetables and whole grains have vitamins, minerals, fiber and antioxidants, which may help prevent cancer. Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables so that you get a range of vitamins and nutrients.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, limit the amount you drink to no more than one drink a day for women and two for men.
 Talk to your health care team about ways to quit.
 Try to get at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days. If you've been inactive, start slowly and build up gradually to 30 minutes. Also, talk with a health care professional before starting an exercise program.
 If you are at a healthy weight, work to maintain your weight by combining a healthy diet with daily exercise. If you need to lose weight, ask your health care team about healthy ways to achieve your goal. Aim to lose weight slowly by eating fewer calories and moving more.

 White people are more likely to develop chronic lymphocytic leukemia than are people of other races.
 A family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia or other blood and bone marrow cancers may increase your risk.
 Certain herbicides and insecticides, including Agent Orange used during the Vietnam War, have been linked to an increased risk of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
 Monoclonal B-cell lymphocytosis (MBL) causes an increased number of one type of lymphocyte (B cells) in the blood. For a small number of people with 
, the condition may develop into chronic lymphocytic leukemia. If you have 
 and also have a family history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, you may have a higher risk of developing cancer.
 If you have chronic lymphocytic leukemia, you may experience frequent infections that can be serious. Sometimes infections happen because your blood doesn't have enough germ-fighting antibodies (immunoglobulins). Your doctor might recommend regular immunoglobulin infusions.
 A small number of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia may develop a more aggressive form of cancer called diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Doctors sometimes refer to this as Richter's syndrome.
 People with chronic lymphocytic leukemia have an increased risk of other types of cancer, including skin cancer and cancers of the lung and the digestive tract.
 A small number of people with chronic lymphocytic leukemia may develop an immune system problem that causes the disease-fighting cells of the immune system to mistakenly attack the red blood cells (autoimmune hemolytic anemia) or the platelets (autoimmune thrombocytopenia).

 A gene mutation can tell a cell to grow and divide more rapidly. This creates many new cells that all have that same mutation.
 Normal cells know when to stop growing so that you have just the right number of each type of cell. Cancer cells lose the controls (tumor suppressor genes) that tell them when to stop growing. A mutation in a tumor suppressor gene allows cancer cells to continue growing and accumulating.
 DNA repair genes look for errors in a cell's DNA and make corrections. A mutation in a DNA repair gene may mean that other errors aren't corrected, leading cells to become cancerous.
 You may be born with a genetic mutation that you inherited from your parents. This type of mutation accounts for a small percentage of cancers.
 Most gene mutations occur after you're born and aren't inherited. A number of forces can cause gene mutations, such as smoking, radiation, viruses, cancer-causing chemicals (carcinogens), obesity, hormones, chronic inflammation and a lack of exercise.
 Pain can be caused by cancer or by cancer treatment, though not all cancer is painful. Medications and other approaches can effectively treat cancer-related pain.
 Fatigue in people with cancer has many causes, but it can often be managed. Fatigue associated with chemotherapy or radiation therapy treatments is common, but it's usually temporary.
 Cancer or cancer treatment may cause a feeling of being short of breath. Treatments may bring relief.
 Certain cancers and cancer treatments can cause nausea. Your doctor can sometimes predict if your treatment is likely to cause nausea. Medications and other treatments may help you prevent or decrease nausea.
 Cancer and cancer treatment can affect your bowels and cause diarrhea or constipation.
 Cancer and cancer treatment may cause weight loss. Cancer steals food from normal cells and deprives them of nutrients. This is often not affected by how many calories or what kind of food is eaten; it's difficult to treat. In most cases, using artificial nutrition through tubes into the stomach or vein does not help change the weight loss.
 Cancer can upset the normal chemical balance in your body and increase your risk of serious complications. Signs and symptoms of chemical imbalances might include excessive thirst, frequent urination, constipation and confusion.
 Cancer can press on nearby nerves and cause pain and loss of function of one part of your body. Cancer that involves the brain can cause headaches and stroke-like signs and symptoms, such as weakness on one side of your body.
 In some cases the body's immune system may react to the presence of cancer by attacking healthy cells. Called paraneoplastic syndromes, these very rare reactions can lead to a variety of signs and symptoms, such as difficulty walking and seizures.
 As cancer advances, it may spread (metastasize) to other parts of the body. Where cancer spreads depends on the type of cancer.
 Cancer survivors have a risk of cancer recurrence. Some cancers are more likely to recur than others. Ask your doctor about what you can do to reduce your risk of cancer recurrence. Your doctor may devise a follow-up care plan for you after treatment. This plan may include periodic scans and exams in the months and years after your treatment, to look for cancer recurrence.
 If you smoke, quit. If you don't smoke, don't start. Smoking is linked to several types of cancer — not just lung cancer. Stopping now will reduce your risk of cancer in the future.
 Harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the sun can increase your risk of skin cancer. Limit your sun exposure by staying in the shade, wearing protective clothing or applying sunscreen.
 Choose a diet rich in fruits and vegetables. Select whole grains and lean proteins. Limit your intake of processed meats.
 Regular exercise is linked to a lower risk of cancer. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. If you haven't been exercising regularly, start out slowly and work your way up to 30 minutes or longer.
 Being overweight or obese may increase your risk of cancer. Work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight through a combination of a healthy diet and regular exercise.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
 Talk to your doctor about what types of cancer screening exams are best for you based on your risk factors.
 Certain viruses increase your risk of cancer. Immunizations may help prevent those viruses, including hepatitis B, which increases the risk of liver cancer, and human papillomavirus (HPV), which increases the risk of cervical cancer and other cancers.

 are rarely painful and tend to develop on pressure spots, such as the heels, the balls of the feet, the palms and the knees. They may vary in size and shape and are often larger than corns.
 Tight shoes and high heels can squeeze areas of the feet. If your shoes are loose, your foot may repeatedly slide and rub against the shoe. Your foot may also rub against a seam or stitch inside the shoe. Socks that don't fit right can also be a problem. 
 Wearing shoes and sandals without socks can cause friction on your feet.
 Calluses on the hands may result from the repeated pressure of activities such as playing instruments and using hand tools or even a pen.
 The type of corn that forms on non-weight-bearing areas, such as the soles and palms (keratosis punctata), might be caused by genetics.
 If you can't wiggle your toes, your shoes are too tight. Have a shoe shop stretch your shoes at any point that rubs or pinches. Shop for shoes when your feet are most swollen, usually at the end of the day. If you use orthotics and inserts, be sure to have them on while fitting your shoes at the store.
 Wear felt pads, nonmedicated corn pads or bandages over areas that rub against your footwear. You can also try toe separators or some lamb's wool between your toes.
 Or try padding your tool handles with cloth tape or covers.

Paraneoplastic syndromes of the nervous system,"Difficulty walking
Difficulty maintaining balance
Loss of muscle coordination
Loss of muscle tone or weakness
Loss of fine motor skills, such as picking up objects
Difficulty swallowing
Slurred speech or stuttering
Memory loss and other thinking (cognitive) impairment
Vision problems
Sleep disturbances
Seizures
Hallucinations
Unusual involuntary movements
 This is the loss of nerve cells in the area of the brain that controls muscle functions and balance (cerebellum). Signs and symptoms may include unsteady or impaired walking, lack of muscle coordination in your limbs, inability to maintain your trunk posture, dizziness, nausea, involuntary eye movement, double vision, difficulty speaking, or difficulty swallowing.
 This is inflammation affecting a region of the brain known as the limbic system, which controls emotions, behaviors and certain memory functions. People with this disorder may experience personality changes or mood disturbances, memory loss, seizures, hallucinations, or drowsiness.
 This syndrome refers to inflammation of the brain and spinal cord. There may be a wide variety of symptoms and signs depending on the area affected.
 This syndrome is due to dysfunction of the cerebellum or its connections. It can cause rapid, irregular eye movements (opsoclonus) and involuntary, chaotic muscle jerks (myoclonus) in your limbs and trunk.
 Previously called stiff man syndrome, this syndrome is characterized by progressive, severe muscle stiffness or rigidity, mainly affecting your spine and legs. It may also cause painful muscle spasms.
 This term refers to a syndrome of injury limited to the spinal cord. Depending on the level of spinal cord injury, you may have changes in bowel and bladder function, and severe weakness and numbness up to a certain level in your body. If the level of injury includes your neck, you can have severe disability affecting all four limbs.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 Neuromyotonia — also known as Isaacs' syndrome — is characterized by abnormal impulses in nerve cells outside the brain and spinal cord (peripheral nerve hyperexcitability) that control muscle movement. These impulses can cause twitching, muscle rippling that looks like a ""bag of worms,"" progressive stiffness, muscle cramps, slowed movement and other muscle impairments.
 This condition refers to patterns of damage to nerves that transmit messages from the brain or spinal column to the rest of your body. When damage involves only the sensory nerves of the peripheral nervous system, you can have pain and disturbances in sensation anywhere in your body.
 Dysautonomia refers to a wide range of signs and symptoms resulting from injury to the nerves that regulate involuntary body functions (autonomic nervous system), such as heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, and bowel and bladder functions. When this part of the nervous system is affected, common symptoms are low blood pressure, irregular heartbeats and trouble breathing.
"
Endometrial cancer,"Vaginal bleeding after menopause.
Bleeding between periods.
Pelvic pain.

    

    

    

    
 Starting menstruation before age 12 or beginning menopause later increases the risk of endometrial cancer. The more periods you've had, the more exposure your endometrium has had to estrogen.
 If you've never been pregnant, you have a higher risk of endometrial cancer than someone who has had at least one pregnancy.
 As you get older, your risk of endometrial cancer increases. Endometrial cancer occurs most often after menopause.
 Being obese increases your risk of endometrial cancer. This may happen because extra body fat can alter your body's balance of hormones.
 Taking the hormone therapy medicine tamoxifen for breast cancer can increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer. If you're taking tamoxifen, talk about the risk with your health care team. For most, the benefits of tamoxifen outweigh the small risk of endometrial cancer.
 Lynch syndrome increases the risk of colon cancer and other cancers, including endometrial cancer. Lynch syndrome is caused by a DNA change that's passed from parents to children. If a family member has been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask your health care team about your risk of this genetic syndrome. If you've been diagnosed with Lynch syndrome, ask what cancer screenings you need.
 If you're considering hormone replacement therapy to help control menopause symptoms, ask about the risks and benefits. Unless you've had your uterus removed, replacing estrogen alone after menopause may increase your risk of endometrial cancer. A hormone therapy medicine that combines estrogen and progestin can reduce this risk. Hormone therapy carries other risks, so weigh the benefits and risks with your health care team.
 Using oral contraceptives for at least one year may reduce endometrial cancer risk. Oral contraceptives are contraceptives that are taken in pill form. They also are called birth control pills. The risk reduction is thought to last for several years after you stop taking oral contraceptives. Oral contraceptives have side effects, though, so discuss the benefits and risks with your health care team.
 Obesity increases the risk of endometrial cancer, so work to achieve and maintain a healthy weight. If you need to lose weight, increase your physical activity and reduce the number of calories you eat each day.

 Severe diarrhea can lead to a serious loss of fluids and minerals called electrolytes. This makes it hard for the body to work as it should. It can cause blood pressure to drop so low as to be dangerous.
 In some cases, dehydration can occur so quickly that the kidneys stop working, called kidney failure.


 This rare condition results from damage to the lining of the colon or occurs after toxic megacolon. Bacteria spilling from the colon into the hollow space in the middle of the body, called the abdominal cavity, can lead to a life-threatening infection called peritonitis.
 Serious C. difficile infection can quickly become fatal if not treated promptly. Rarely, death can occur with mild to moderate infection.


 People who are hospitalized with C. difficile infection have a private room or share a room with someone who has the same illness. Hospital staff and visitors wear disposable gloves and isolation gowns while in the room.
 In any health care setting, all surfaces should be carefully disinfected with a product that has chlorine bleach. C. difficile spores can survive cleaning products that don't have bleach.

Production of mucus (sputum), which can be clear, white, yellowish-gray or green in color — rarely, it may be streaked with blood
Fatigue
Shortness of breath
Slight fever and chills
Chest discomfort
Lasts more than three weeks
Prevents you from sleeping
Is accompanied by fever higher than 100.4 F (38 C)
Produces discolored mucus
Produces blood
Is associated with wheezing or shortness of breath
 People who smoke or who live with a smoker are at higher risk of both acute bronchitis and chronic bronchitis.
 This may result from another acute illness, such as a cold, or from a chronic condition that compromises your immune system. Older adults, infants and young children have greater vulnerability to infection.
 Your risk of developing bronchitis is greater if you work around certain lung irritants, such as grains or textiles, or are exposed to chemical fumes.
 Repeated bouts of severe heartburn can irritate your throat and make you more prone to developing bronchitis.
 Cigarette smoke increases your risk of chronic bronchitis.
 Many cases of acute bronchitis result from influenza, a virus. Getting a yearly flu vaccine can help protect you from getting the flu. You may also want to consider vaccination that protects against some types of pneumonia.
 To reduce your risk of catching a viral infection, wash your hands frequently and get in the habit of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers.
 If you have COPD, you might consider wearing a face mask at work if you're exposed to dust or fumes, and when you're going to be among crowds, such as while traveling.
"
Bronchiolitis,"Runny nose.
Stuffy nose.
Cough.
Sometimes a slight fever.
Has blue or gray skin, lips and fingernails due to low oxygen levels.
Struggles to breathe and can't speak or cry.
Refuses to drink enough, or breathes too fast to eat or drink.
Breathes very fast — in infants this can be more than 60 breaths a minute — with short, shallow breaths.
Can't breathe easily and the ribs seem to suck inward when breathing in.
Makes wheezing sounds when breathing.
Makes grunting noises with each breath.
Appears slow moving, weak or very tired.
Being born too early.
Having a heart or lung condition.
Having a weakened immune system. This makes it hard to fight infections.
Being around tobacco smoke.
Contact with lots of other children, such as in a child care setting.
Spending time in crowded places.
Having siblings who go to school or get child care services and bring home the infection.
Low oxygen in the body.
Pauses in breathing, which is most likely to happen in babies born too early and in babies under 2 months old.
Not being able to drink enough liquids. This can cause dehydration, when too much body fluid is lost.
Not being able to get the amount of oxygen needed. This is called respiratory failure.
 If your child is a newborn, especially a premature newborn, avoid being around people with colds. This is especially important in the first two months of life.
 Clean and disinfect surfaces and items that people often touch, such as toys and doorknobs. This is especially important if a family member is sick.
 Frequently wash your own hands and those of your child. Wash with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Keep an alcohol-based hand sanitizer handy to use when you're away from home. Make sure it contains at least 60% alcohol.
 Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue. Throw away the tissue. Then wash your hands. If soap and water aren't available, use a hand sanitizer. If you don't have a tissue, cough or sneeze into your elbow, not your hands.
 Don't share glasses with others, especially if someone in your family is ill.
 Respiratory infections are less common in breastfed babies.

Broken wrist,"Severe pain that might worsen when gripping or squeezing or moving your hand or wrist
Swelling
Tenderness
Bruising
Obvious deformity, such as a bent wrist
 Falling onto an outstretched hand is one of the most common causes of a broken wrist.
 Many wrist fractures occur during contact sports or sports in which you might fall onto an outstretched hand — such as in-line skating or snowboarding.
 Motor vehicle crashes can cause wrist bones to break, sometimes into many pieces, and often require surgical repair.
Football or soccer, especially on artificial turf
Rugby
Horseback riding
Hockey
Skiing
Snowboarding
In-line skating
Jumping on a trampoline
 Stiffness, pain or aching in the affected area generally goes away eventually after your cast is removed or after surgery. However, some people have permanent stiffness or pain. Be patient with your recovery, and talk to your doctor about exercises that might help or for a referral to physical or occupational therapy.
 Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later. If your wrist starts to hurt or swell long after a break, see your doctor for an evaluation.
 Trauma to the wrist can injure adjacent nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate attention if you have numbness or circulation problems.
Eat a nutritious diet with adequate calcium and vitamin D
Get plenty of weight-bearing exercise, such as brisk walking
Quit smoking if you're a smoker
Wear sensible shoes
Remove things you can trip over in your home, such as throw rugs
Light up your living space
Have your vision checked and, if needed, corrected
Install grab bars in your bathroom
Install handrails on your stairways
Avoid slippery surfaces, if possible, such as snow- or ice-covered walkways
In-line skating
Snowboarding
Rugby
Football
"
Broken toe,"Pain
Swelling
Change in skin color from bruising or bleeding under the skin
 If the skin is cut near the injured toe, the risk of getting an infection in the bone increases.
 This wear-and-tear type of arthritis is more likely to occur when the break affects one of the toe joints.
"
Broken ribs,"A deep breath.
Pressure on the injured area.
A bend or a twist of the body.
 This disease in which bones lose their bulk increases the risk of breaking a bone.
 Playing contact sports, such as hockey or football, increases the risk of injury to the chest.
 Cancer can weaken the bone, making it more likely to break.
 A sharp end from a break in one of the first three ribs at the top of the rib cage could pierce a major blood vessel, including the aorta.
 The jagged end of a broken middle rib can punch a hole in a lung and cause it to cave in.
 The bottom two ribs rarely break because they can move more than the upper and middle ribs. But the ends of a broken lower rib can cause serious harm to the spleen, liver or a kidney.
 Wear protective equipment when playing contact sports.
 Remove clutter from floors. Wipe up spills right away. Use a rubber mat in the shower. Keep your home well lit. Put backing on carpets and area rugs to keep them from sliding.
 Getting enough calcium and vitamin D in the diet is important for strong bones. Get about 1,200 milligrams of calcium and 600 international units of vitamin D daily from food and supplements.
"
Carcinoid tumors,"Chest pain
Wheezing
Shortness of breath
Diarrhea
Redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing)
Weight gain, particularly around the midsection and upper back
Pink or purple marks on the skin that look like stretch marks
Abdominal pain
Diarrhea
Nausea, vomiting and inability to pass stool due to intestinal blockage (bowel obstruction)
Rectal bleeding
Rectal pain
Redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing)
 Older adults are more likely to be diagnosed with a carcinoid tumor than are younger people or children.
 Women are more likely than men to develop carcinoid tumors.
 A family history of multiple endocrine neoplasia, type 1 (MEN 1), increases the risk of carcinoid tumors. In people with 
 multiple tumors occur in glands of the endocrine system.
 Carcinoid syndrome causes redness or a feeling of warmth in your face and neck (skin flushing), chronic diarrhea, and difficulty breathing, among other signs and symptoms.
 Carcinoid tumors may secrete hormones that can cause thickening of the lining of heart chambers, valves and blood vessels. This can lead to leaky heart valves and heart failure that may require valve-replacement surgery. Carcinoid heart disease can usually be controlled with medications.
 A lung carcinoid tumor can produce an excess of a hormone that can cause your body to produce too much of the hormone cortisol.
"
Broken leg,"Severe pain, which may worsen with movement
Swelling
Tenderness
Bruising
Obvious deformity or shortening of the affected leg
Inability to walk
 A simple fall can fracture one or both lower leg bones. A much higher impact is usually needed to break the thighbone.
 All three leg bones can break during a motor vehicle accident. Fractures can occur when your knees become jammed against the dashboard during a collision or with damage to the car hitting your legs.
 Extending your leg beyond its natural limits during contact sports can cause a broken leg. So can a fall or a direct blow — such as from a hockey stick or an opponent's body.
 In children, a broken leg may be the result of child abuse, especially when such an injury occurs before the child can walk.
 Stress fractures are tiny cracks that develop in the weight-bearing bones of the body, including the shinbone. Stress fractures are usually caused by repetitive force or overuse, such as running long distances. But they can occur with regular use of a bone that's been weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.
Running
Ballet dancing
Basketball
Marching
Decreased bone density (osteoporosis)
Diabetes
Rheumatoid arthritis
 A broken bone in your leg may produce pain in your knee or ankle.
 If a broken bone cuts through the skin and causes a wound, it is called an open fracture. If you have an open fracture, the bone may be exposed to germs that can cause infection.
 A severe leg fracture may not heal quickly or completely. This is particularly common in an open fracture of the tibia because of lower blood flow to this bone.
 Leg fractures can injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate medical help if you notice any numbness, pale skin or circulation problems.
 This condition causes pain, swelling and sometimes disability in muscles near the broken bone. This is a rare complication that is more common with high-impact injuries, such as a car or motorcycle accident.
 Fractures that extend into the joint and poor bone alignment can cause osteoarthritis years later. If your leg starts to hurt long after a break, see your health care provider for an evaluation.
 The long bones of a child grow from the ends of the bones, in softer areas called growth plates. If a fracture goes through a growth plate, that limb might eventually become shorter or longer than the opposite limb.
 Calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, can help build strong bones. A calcium or vitamin D supplement also may improve bone strength. Ask your health care provider if these supplements are right for you.
 Choose the appropriate shoe for your favorite sports or activities. And replace athletic shoes regularly. Discard sneakers as soon as the tread or heel wears out or if the shoes are wearing unevenly.
 Alternating activities can prevent stress fractures. Rotate running with swimming or biking. If you run on a sloped track indoors, alternate the direction of your running to even out the stress on your skeleton.
"
Broken collarbone,"Pain that increases when moving the shoulder.
Swelling, tenderness or bruising.
Skin over the break might look like a tent when gently pinched.
A bump on or near the shoulder.
A grinding or crackling sound when moving the shoulder.
Stiffness or not being able to move the shoulder.
 such as falling onto the shoulder or onto an outstretched arm.
 such as a direct blow to the shoulder on the field, rink or court.
 from a car, motorcycle or bike crash.
 usually from a difficult vaginal birth.
 Rarely, the jagged ends of a broken collarbone may injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate medical attention for numbness or coldness in an arm or hand.
 A badly broken collarbone might heal slowly or not all the way. Poor joining of the bones during healing can shorten the bone.
 As part of the healing process, the place where the bone knits together forms a bony lump. The lump is easy to see because it's close to the skin. Most lumps disappear over time, but not all.
 A fracture that involves the joints that connect the collarbone to the shoulder blade or the breastbone might increase the risk of later developing arthritis in that joint.

Breast pain,"Continues daily for more than a couple of weeks
Occurs in one specific area of your breast
Seems to be getting worse over time
Interferes with daily activities
Awakens you from sleep
 People who have large breasts may experience noncyclic breast pain related to the size of their breasts. Neck, shoulder and back pain may accompany breast pain that's caused by large breasts.
 Breast pain associated with breast surgery and scar formation can sometimes linger after incisions have healed.
 An imbalance of fatty acids within the cells may affect the sensitivity of breast tissue to circulating hormones.
 Certain hormonal medications, including some infertility treatments and oral birth control pills, may be associated with breast pain. Breast tenderness is a possible side effect of estrogen and progesterone hormone therapies that are used after menopause. Breast pain may be associated with certain antidepressants, including selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants. Other medicines that can cause breast pain include those used to treat high blood pressure and some antibiotics.
 Although more research is needed, some people notice an improvement in breast pain when they reduce or eliminate caffeine.

Mastitis,"Breast tenderness or warmth to the touch
Breast swelling
Thickening of breast tissue, or a breast lump
Pain or a burning sensation continuously or while breast-feeding
Skin redness, often in a wedge-shaped pattern
Generally feeling ill
Fever of 101 F (38.3 C) or greater
 If a breast doesn't completely empty at feedings, one of your milk ducts can become clogged. The blockage causes milk to back up, leading to breast infection.
 Bacteria from your skin's surface and baby's mouth can enter the milk ducts through a crack in the skin of your nipple or through a milk duct opening. Stagnant milk in a breast that isn't emptied provides a breeding ground for the bacteria.
Previous bout of mastitis while breast-feeding
Sore or cracked nipples — although mastitis can develop without broken skin
Wearing a tightfitting bra or putting pressure on your breast when using a seat belt or carrying a heavy bag, which may restrict milk flow
Improper nursing technique
Becoming overly tired or stressed
Poor nutrition
Smoking
Fully drain the milk from your breasts while breast-feeding.
Allow your baby to completely empty one breast before switching to the other breast during feeding.
Change the position you use to breast-feed from one feeding to the next.
Make sure your baby latches on properly during feedings.
If you smoke, ask your doctor about smoking cessation.

 Women are much more likely than men are to develop breast cancer.
 Your risk of breast cancer increases as you age.
 If you've had a breast biopsy that found lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) or atypical hyperplasia of the breast, you have an increased risk of breast cancer.
 If you've had breast cancer in one breast, you have an increased risk of developing cancer in the other breast.
 If your mother, sister or daughter was diagnosed with breast cancer, particularly at a young age, your risk of breast cancer is increased. Still, the majority of people diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history of the disease.
 Certain gene mutations that increase the risk of breast cancer can be passed from parents to children. The most well-known gene mutations are referred to as BRCA1 and BRCA2. These genes can greatly increase your risk of breast cancer and other cancers, but they don't make cancer inevitable.
 If you received radiation treatments to your chest as a child or young adult, your risk of breast cancer is increased.
 Being obese increases your risk of breast cancer.
 Beginning your period before age 12 increases your risk of breast cancer.
 If you began menopause at an older age, you're more likely to develop breast cancer.
 Women who give birth to their first child after age 30 may have an increased risk of breast cancer.
 Women who have never been pregnant have a greater risk of breast cancer than do women who have had one or more pregnancies.
 Women who take hormone therapy medications that combine estrogen and progesterone to treat the signs and symptoms of menopause have an increased risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer decreases when women stop taking these medications.
 Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 Limit the amount of alcohol you drink to no more than one drink a day, if you choose to drink.
 Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise on most days of the week. If you haven't been active lately, ask your doctor whether it's OK and start slowly.

    

    

    

    
 If your weight is healthy, work to maintain that weight. If you need to lose weight, ask your doctor about healthy strategies to accomplish this. Reduce the number of calories you eat each day and slowly increase the amount of exercise.
 Women who eat a Mediterranean diet supplemented with extra-virgin olive oil and mixed nuts may have a reduced risk of breast cancer. The Mediterranean diet focuses mostly on plant-based foods, such as fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and nuts. People who follow the Mediterranean diet choose healthy fats, such as olive oil, over butter and fish instead of red meat.

    

    

    
 Women with a very high risk of breast cancer may choose to have their healthy breasts surgically removed (prophylactic mastectomy). They may also choose to have their healthy ovaries removed (prophylactic oophorectomy) to reduce the risk of both breast cancer and ovarian cancer.

Brain tumor," 
 are growths of cells that look like glial cells. The glial cells surround and support nerve cells in the brain tissue. Types of gliomas and related brain tumors include 
, 
, 
 and 
. Gliomas can be benign, but most are malignant. Glioblastoma is the most common type of malignant brain tumor.
 Choroid plexus tumors start in cells that make the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. This fluid is called cerebrospinal fluid. Choroid plexus tumors are located in the fluid-filled cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. Choroid plexus tumors can be benign or malignant. 
 is the malignant form of this type of brain tumor. It's more common in children.

 start in reproductive cells, called germ cells, that go on to become the sperm and egg cells. Germ cells are mostly in the ovaries and testicles. But sometimes they're in other parts of the body, including the brain. When germ cell tumors happen in the brain, they're often located near the pineal gland or the pituitary gland. Germ cell tumors are mostly benign. They're more common in children.
 Pineal tumors start in and around the brain's pineal gland. The pineal gland is located in the center of the brain. It makes a hormone called melatonin that helps with sleep. Pineal tumors can be benign or malignant. 
 is a malignant type of pineal tumor that's most common in children.
 
 are brain tumors that start in the membranes around the brain and spinal cord. Meningiomas are usually benign, but sometimes they can be malignant. Meningiomas are the most common type of benign brain tumor.
 Nerve tumors are growths that happen in and around nerves. The most common type that happens in the head is 
, also called schwannoma. This benign tumor is located on the main nerve that connects the inner ear to the brain.
 Brain tumors can begin in and around the pituitary gland. This small gland is located near the base of the brain. Most tumors that happen in and around the pituitary gland are benign. 
 happen in the pituitary gland itself. 
 is a type of brain tumor that happens near the pituitary gland.
 Many other types of rare tumors can happen in and around the brain. Tumors can start in the muscles, blood vessels and connective tissue around the brain. Tumors can form in the bones of the skull. Malignant brain tumors can start from the germ-fighting immune system cells in the brain. This type of brain cancer is called primary central nervous system lymphoma.
Headache or pressure in the head that is worse in the morning.
Headaches that happen more often and seem more severe.
Headaches that are sometimes described as tension headaches or migraines.

 The frontal lobes are in the front of the brain. They control thinking and movement. Frontal lobe brain tumors might cause balance problems and trouble walking. There might be personality changes, such as forgetfulness and lack of interest in usual activities. Sometimes family members notice that the person with the brain tumor seems different.
 The parietal lobes are in the upper middle part of the brain. They help process information about touch, taste, smell, vision and hearing. Parietal lobe brain tumors can cause problems related to the senses. Examples include vision problems and hearing problems.
 The occipital lobes are in the back of the brain. They control vision. Occipital lobe brain tumors can cause vision loss.
 The temporal lobes are on the sides of the brain. They process memories and senses. Temporal lobe brain tumors can cause memory problems. They might cause someone to see, taste or smell something that isn't there. Sometimes the taste or smell is unpleasant or unusual.
Breast cancer.
Colon cancer.
Kidney cancer.
Lung cancer.
Melanoma.
 Brain tumors can happen at any age, but they happen most often in older adults. Some brain tumors mostly affect adults. Some brain tumors happen most often in children.
 Anyone can get a brain tumor. But some types of brain tumors are more common in people of certain races. For example, gliomas are more common in white people. Meningiomas are more common in Black people.

    

    

    
 Some DNA changes that increase the risk of brain tumor run in families. Examples include the DNA changes that cause neurofibromatosis 1 and 2, tuberous sclerosis, Lynch syndrome, Li-Fraumeni syndrome, Von Hippel-Lindau disease, familial adenomatous polyposis, Cowden syndrome, and Gorlin syndrome.

 which is the colored part in the front of the eye
 which is the layer of blood vessels and connective tissue between the sclera and the retina at the back of the uvea
 which is in the front of the uvea and secretes the transparent liquid (aqueous humor) into the eye.
 People with blue eyes or green eyes have a greater risk of melanoma of the eye.
 White people have a greater risk of eye melanoma than do people of other races.
 The risk of eye melanoma increases with age.

    

    

    
 The role of ultraviolet exposure in eye melanoma is unclear. There's some evidence that exposure to 
 light, such as light from the sun or from tanning beds, may increase the risk of eye melanoma.
 Certain genes passed from parents to children may increase the risk of eye melanoma.
 A growing eye melanoma may cause glaucoma. Signs and symptoms of glaucoma may include eye pain and redness, as well as blurry vision.

    

    

    
 Eye melanoma can spread outside of the eye and to distant areas of the body, including the liver, lungs and bones.

 In the mildest form, all electrical signals from the atria reach the ventricles, but the signal is slowed. First-degree heart block rarely causes symptoms and usually needs no treatment if there's no other problem in electrical signaling.
 Not all electrical signals reach the ventricles. Some beats are dropped, resulting in a slower and sometimes irregular heart rhythm.
 None of the electrical signals from the atria reaches the ventricles. When this happens, the ventricles will usually beat on their own but at a very slow rate.

 Your health care provider may give you recommendations about how much and what type of exercise is best for you.
 Choose a healthy, low-fat, low-salt, low-sugar diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.
 Being overweight increases the risk of developing heart disease.
 Make lifestyle changes and take medications as prescribed to manage high blood pressure, diabetes and high cholesterol.
 If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies or programs to help.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. If you can't control your alcohol use, talk to a health care provider about a program to quit drinking and manage other behaviors related to alcohol abuse.
 Intense emotions may affect heart rate. Some ways to relieve stress are getting regular exercise, joining a support group and trying relaxation techniques, such as yoga.

Brachial plexus injury,"A feeling like an electric shock or a burning sensation shooting down the arm
Numbness and weakness in the arm
Weakness or inability to use certain muscles in the hand, arm or shoulder
Complete lack of movement and feeling in the arm, including the shoulder and hand
Severe pain
Recurrent burners and stingers
Weakness in the hand or arm
Neck pain
Symptoms in both arms
 Many football players experience burners or stingers, which can occur when the nerves in the brachial plexus get stretched beyond their limit during collisions with other players.
 Newborns can sustain brachial plexus injuries. These may be associated with high birth weight, breech presentation or prolonged labor. If an infant's shoulders get wedged within the birth canal, there is an increased risk of a brachial plexus palsy. Most often, the upper nerves are injured, a condition called Erb's palsy.
 Several types of trauma — including motor vehicle accidents, motorcycle accidents, falls or bullet wounds — can result in brachial plexus injuries.
 Radiation treatment to the chest or neck may cause tumors to grow in or along the brachial plexus, or put pressure on the brachial plexus or spread to the nerves. Radiation treatment to the chest may cause damage to the brachial plexus.
 If you experience paralysis of the hand or arm, the joints can stiffen. This can make movement difficult, even if you eventually regain use of the limb. For that reason, your provider is likely to recommend ongoing physical therapy during your recovery.
 This results from nerve damage and may become chronic.
 If you lose feeling in the arm or hand, you run the risk of burning or injuring yourself without knowing it.
 Nerves regrow slowly and can take several years to heal after injury. During that time, lack of use may cause the affected muscles to break down.
 How well you recover from a serious brachial plexus injury depends on a number of factors, including your age and the type, location and severity of the injury. Even with surgery, some people experience permanent muscle weakness or paralysis.


 If you're the parent of a child with a brachial plexus palsy, it's important that you exercise your child's joints and functioning muscles every day, beginning when your baby is just a few weeks old. This helps prevent the joints from becoming permanently stiff and keeps your child's working muscles strong and healthy.

Male breast cancer,"A painless lump or thickening of the skin on the chest.
Changes to the skin covering the chest, such as dimpling, puckering, scaling or changes in the color of the skin.
Changes to the nipple, such as changes in the skin color or scaling, or a nipple that begins to turn inward.
Discharge or bleeding from the nipple.
 This type of breast cancer starts in the tubes that connect to the nipple. These tubes are called ducts. Ductal carcinoma is the most common type of male breast cancer.
 This type of cancer begins in the glands that have the potential to make breast milk. These glands are called lobules. Lobular carcinoma is less common in people assigned male at birth because they usually have fewer lobular cells.
 Other, rarer types of male breast cancer include Paget's disease of the nipple and inflammatory breast cancer.
 The risk of breast cancer increases with age. Male breast cancer is most often diagnosed in men in their 60s.
 If you take estrogen-related medicines, such as those used for hormone therapy for prostate cancer, your risk of breast cancer rises.
 If you have a blood relative with breast cancer, you have a greater chance of getting the disease.
 Some of the DNA changes that can lead to breast cancer are passed down from parents to children. People born with these DNA changes have a greater risk of breast cancer. For example, the DNA changes BRCA1 and BRCA2 increase the risk of male breast cancer.
 This genetic syndrome occurs when males are born with more than one copy of the X chromosome. Klinefelter syndrome affects the development of the testicles. It causes changes in the balance of hormones in the body, which can increase the risk of male breast cancer.
 Certain conditions, such as cirrhosis of the liver, can change the balance of hormones in the body. This raises the risk of male breast cancer.
 Obesity is linked with higher levels of estrogen in the body. This increases the risk of male breast cancer.
 Having inflamed testicles, called orchitis, or surgery to remove a testicle, called orchiectomy, can increase the risk of male breast cancer.

 Some studies of twins and families suggest that personality disorders may be inherited or strongly associated with other mental health disorders among family members.
 Some research has shown changes in certain areas of the brain involved in emotion regulation, impulsivity and aggression. In addition, certain brain chemicals that help regulate mood, such as serotonin, may not function properly.
 You may be at a higher risk if a close relative — your mother, father, brother or sister — has the same or a similar disorder.
 Many people with the disorder report being sexually or physically abused or neglected during childhood. Some people have lost or were separated from a parent or close caregiver when they were young or had parents or caregivers with substance misuse or other mental health issues. Others have been exposed to hostile conflict and unstable family relationships.

Bone spurs," Bone spurs in your knee can make it painful to extend and bend your leg.
 On your vertebrae, bone spurs can narrow the space that contains your spinal cord. These bone spurs can pinch the spinal cord or its nerve roots and can cause weakness or numbness in your arms or legs.
 Bone spurs can make it painful to move your hip, although you might feel the pain in your knee. Depending on their placement, bone spurs can reduce the range of motion in your hip joint.
"
Osteomyelitis,"Fever
Swelling, warmth and redness over the area of the infection
Pain in the area of the infection
Fatigue
 Germs in other parts of your body — for example, in the lungs from pneumonia or in the bladder from a urinary tract infection — can travel through your bloodstream to a weakened spot in a bone.
 Severe puncture wounds can carry germs deep inside your body. If such an injury becomes infected, the germs can spread into a nearby bone. Germs can also enter the body if you have broken a bone so severely that part of it is sticking out through your skin.
 Direct contamination with germs can occur during surgeries to replace joints or repair fractures.
Poorly controlled diabetes
Peripheral artery disease, often related to smoking
Sickle cell disease
Dialysis machine tubing
Urinary catheters
Long-term intravenous tubing, sometimes called central lines
Cancer treatment
Poorly controlled diabetes
Needing to take corticosteroids or drugs called tumor necrosis factor inhibitors
 An infection in your bone can impede blood circulation within the bone, leading to bone death. Areas where bone has died need to be surgically removed for antibiotics to be effective.
 Sometimes, infection within bones can spread into a nearby joint.
 Normal growth in bones or joints in children may be affected if osteomyelitis occurs in the softer areas, called growth plates, at either end of the long bones of the arms and legs.
 If your osteomyelitis has resulted in an open sore that is draining pus, the surrounding skin is at higher risk of developing squamous cell cancer.
"
Fecal incontinence,"Diarrhea.
Constipation.
Gas and bloating.
 Injury to the rings of muscle at the end of the rectum may make it difficult to hold in stool. These rings are known as the anal sphincter. This kind of damage can occur during childbirth. This is most commonly due to having an episiotomy or using forceps during delivery.
 Injury to the nerves that sense stool in the rectum or those that control the anal sphincter can lead to fecal incontinence. Many things can damage these nerves, including:
    

    
 Chronic constipation may cause a dry, hard mass of stool to form in the rectum and become too large to pass. This is known as stool impaction. The muscles of the rectum and intestines stretch and eventually weaken. This allows watery stool from farther up the digestive tract to move around the impacted stool and leak out. Long-lasting constipation also may cause nerve damage that leads to fecal incontinence.
 Solid stool is easier to hold in the rectum than is loose stool, so the loose stools of diarrhea can cause or worsen fecal incontinence.
 Hemorrhoids are swollen veins in the rectum. These swollen veins can keep the anus from closing completely, letting stool leak out.
 Usually, the rectum stretches to accommodate stool. If the rectum is scarred or stiff it can't stretch as much as it needs to, and excess stool can leak out. Things such as surgery, radiation treatment or inflammatory bowel disease can stiffen and scar the rectum.
 Surgery involving the rectum and anus, such as hemorrhoid removal, can cause muscle and nerve damage that leads to fecal incontinence.
 Fecal incontinence can be a result of this condition, in which the rectum drops down into the anus. The stretching of the rectal sphincter by prolapse damages the nerves that control the rectal sphincter. The longer this lasts, the less likely the nerves and muscles will recover.
 In women, fecal incontinence can occur if the rectum protrudes through the vagina. This condition is known as rectocele.
 Although fecal incontinence can occur at any age, it's more common in adults over 65.
 Fecal incontinence can be a complication of childbirth. Recent research also has found that women who take menopausal hormone replacement therapy have a modest increased risk of fecal incontinence.
 People who have long-standing diabetes, multiple sclerosis, or back trauma from injury or surgery may be at risk of fecal incontinence. These conditions can damage nerves that help control defecation.
 Fecal incontinence is often present in late-stage Alzheimer's disease and dementia.
 Being physically disabled may make it difficult to reach a toilet in time. An injury that caused a physical disability also may cause rectal nerve damage, leading to fecal incontinence.
 Losing control over bodily functions can lead to feeling uneasy about being out in public. It's common for people with fecal incontinence to try to hide the problem or to avoid social engagements.
 The skin around the anus is delicate and sensitive. Repeated contact with stool can lead to pain and itching. It also may lead to sores, also called ulcers. Ulcers often require medical treatment.
 Increase your exercise, eat more high-fiber foods and drink plenty of fluids.
 Treating or eliminating the cause of the diarrhea, such as an intestinal infection, may help you avoid fecal incontinence.
 Straining during bowel movements can eventually weaken anal sphincter muscles or damage nerves.

Bone cancer,"Bone pain
Swelling and tenderness near the affected area
Weakened bone, leading to fracture
Fatigue

 Osteosarcoma is the most common form of bone cancer. In this tumor, the cancerous cells produce bone. This variety of bone cancer occurs most often in children and young adults, in the bones of the leg or arm. In rare circumstances, osteosarcomas can arise outside of bones (extraskeletal osteosarcomas).
 Chondrosarcoma is the second most common form of bone cancer. In this tumor, the cancerous cells produce cartilage. Chondrosarcoma usually occurs in the pelvis, legs or arms in middle-aged and older adults.
 Ewing sarcoma tumors most commonly arise in the pelvis, legs or arms of children and young adults.
 Certain rare genetic syndromes passed through families increase the risk of bone cancer, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome and hereditary retinoblastoma.
 Most commonly occurring in older adults, Paget's disease of bone can increase the risk of bone cancer developing later.
 Exposure to large doses of radiation, such as those given during radiation therapy for cancer, increases the risk of bone cancer in the future.

Blood in urine (hematuria)," These happen when bacteria get into the tube through which urine leaves the body, called the urethra. Then the bacteria multiply in the bladder. 
 can cause bleeding that makes urine look red, pink or brown. With a 
, you also may have a strong urge to pee that lasts a long time. You may have pain and burning while peeing. Your urine may have a very strong smell too.
 This type of 
 also is called pyelonephritis
 Kidney infections can happen when bacteria enter the kidneys from the bloodstream. Infections also can happen when bacteria move to the kidneys from a pair of tubes that connect the kidneys with the bladder, called the ureters. Kidney infections can cause the same urine-related symptoms that other 
 can. But they're more likely to cause a fever and pain in the back, side or groin.

    

    

    
 The prostate gland is just below the bladder, and it surrounds the top part of the urethra. It often gets bigger toward middle age. It then puts pressure on the urethra, partly blocking the flow of urine. With an enlarged prostate, you might have trouble peeing, an urgent or lasting need to pee, or blood in the urine. Infection of the prostate, called prostatitis, can cause the same symptoms.

    

    

    
 Blood in urine that can be seen with the naked eye may be a sign of advanced kidney, bladder or prostate cancer. These cancers might not cause symptoms sooner, when treatments could work better.
 A genetic condition that affects red blood cells, called sickle cell anemia, can cause blood in urine. The blood cells could be visible or too tiny to see. A condition that damages tiny blood vessels in the kidneys, called Alport syndrome, also can cause blood in the urine.
 A blow or other injury to the kidneys from an accident or contact sports can cause blood to show up in urine.
. The anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide (Cytoxan) and the antibiotic penicillin are linked to blood in urine. Medicines that prevent blood clots also are tied to blood in urine. These include medicines that keep blood cells called platelets from sticking together, such as the pain reliever aspirin. Medicines that thin the blood, such as heparin, also may be a cause.

    

    

    
 Middle-aged and older men may be more likely to have hematuria due to an enlarged prostate gland. The risk of some cancers that can cause blood in urine also may rise after the age of 50.
 This is one of the top causes of blood that can be seen in children's urine.
 The chances of having blood in the urine may go up if one or more family members have had kidney disease.
 Some pain relievers, blood thinners and antibiotics can raise the risk of blood in urine.
 Marathon runner's hematuria is one nickname for hematuria. Contact sports can raise the risk too.

Cystitis,"A strong, persistent urge to urinate
Pain or a burning feeling when urinating
Passing frequent, small amounts of urine
Blood in the urine (hematuria)
Passing cloudy or strong-smelling urine
Pelvic discomfort
A feeling of pressure in the area below your belly button (abdomen)
Low-grade fever
Back or side pain
Fever and chills
Nausea and vomiting
 The cause of this chronic bladder inflammation, also called painful bladder syndrome, is not clear. Most cases happen in women. The condition can be difficult to diagnose and treat.
 Some medicines, such as certain drugs used to treat cancer (chemotherapy), can cause inflammation of the bladder as the broken-down components of the drugs exit the body.
 Radiation treatment of the pelvic area can cause inflammatory changes in bladder tissue.
 Long-term use of a catheter can make bacterial infections and tissue damage more likely. Both of these can cause bladder inflammation.
 Some people may be extra sensitive to chemicals found in certain products. These might include bubble bath, personal hygiene spray or spermicidal jelly. An allergic-type reaction can happen within the bladder, causing inflammation.
 Cystitis may sometimes occur as a complication of other conditions, such as diabetes, kidney stones, an enlarged prostate or spinal cord injury.
 During sex, bacteria can be pushed into the urethra.
 Using a diaphragm increases the risk of a 
. Diaphragms that contain spermicide may increase risk even more.
 Hormone changes during pregnancy may increase the risk of a bladder infection.
 Changes to hormones that happen after menopause often can lead to 
.
 This can occur in conditions such as a stone in the bladder or an enlarged prostate.
This can happen with certain conditions, such as diabetes, 
 infection and cancer treatment.
 These tubes may be needed in people with chronic illnesses or in older adults. Prolonged use can put you at greater risk of bacterial infections as well as bladder tissue damage.
 An untreated bladder infection can lead to a kidney infection. This is also called pyelonephritis (pie-uh-low-nuh-FRY-tis). Kidney infections may permanently damage the kidneys.

    

    

    
 Drinking lots of fluids is especially important after chemotherapy or radiation therapy, particularly on treatment days.
 If you feel the urge to urinate, don't delay using the toilet.
 This prevents bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra.
 If you're prone to infections, showering rather than taking a bath may help prevent them.
 Do this daily, but don't use harsh soaps or wash too vigorously. The delicate skin in this area can become irritated.
 Drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria.
 These products can irritate the urethra and bladder.
"
Bladder exstrophy," This is the least severe form of 
, in which the tube to expel urine (urethra) doesn't fully develop.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 Firstborn children, children of a parent with bladder exstrophy or siblings of a child with bladder exstrophy have an increased chance of being born with the condition.
 Bladder exstrophy is more common in whites than in other races.
 More boys than girls are born with bladder exstrophy.
 Children born through assisted reproductive technology, such as IVF, have a higher risk of bladder exstrophy.
"
Urinary incontinence," Urine leaks when you exert pressure on your bladder by coughing, sneezing, laughing, exercising or lifting something heavy.
 You have a sudden, intense urge to urinate followed by an involuntary loss of urine. You may need to urinate often, including throughout the night. Urge incontinence may be caused by a minor condition, such as infection, or a more severe condition such as a neurological disorder or diabetes.
 You experience frequent or constant dribbling of urine due to a bladder that doesn't empty completely.
 A physical or mental impairment keeps you from making it to the toilet in time. For example, if you have severe arthritis, you may not be able to unbutton your pants quickly enough.
 You experience more than one type of urinary incontinence — most often this refers to a combination of stress incontinence and urge incontinence.
Cause you to restrict your activities and limit your social interactions
Negatively impact your quality of life
Increase the risk of falls in older adults as they rush to the toilet

Foods that are high in spice, sugar or acid, especially citrus fruits
Heart and blood pressure medications, sedatives, and muscle relaxants
Large doses of vitamin C
 Infections can irritate your bladder, causing you to have strong urges to urinate and, sometimes, incontinence.
 The rectum is located near the bladder and shares many of the same nerves. Hard, compacted stool in your rectum causes these nerves to be overactive and increase urinary frequency.
 Hormonal changes and the increased weight of the fetus can lead to stress incontinence.
 Vaginal delivery can weaken muscles needed for bladder control and damage bladder nerves and supportive tissue, leading to a dropped (prolapsed) pelvic floor. With prolapse, the bladder, uterus, rectum or small intestine can get pushed down from the usual position and protrude into the vagina. Such protrusions may be associated with incontinence.
 Aging of the bladder muscle can decrease the bladder's capacity to store urine. Also, involuntary bladder contractions become more frequent as you get older.
 After menopause, women produce less estrogen, a hormone that helps keep the lining of the bladder and urethra healthy. Deterioration of these tissues can aggravate incontinence.
 Especially in older men, incontinence often stems from enlargement of the prostate gland, a condition known as benign prostatic hyperplasia.
 In men, stress incontinence or urge incontinence can be associated with untreated prostate cancer. But more often, incontinence is a side effect of treatments for prostate cancer.
 A tumor anywhere along your urinary tract can block the normal flow of urine, leading to overflow incontinence. Urinary stones — hard, stonelike masses that form in the bladder — sometimes cause urine leakage.
 Multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, a stroke, a brain tumor or a spinal injury can interfere with nerve signals involved in bladder control, causing urinary incontinence.
 Women are more likely to have stress incontinence. Pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and normal female anatomy account for this difference. However, men who have prostate gland problems are at increased risk of urge and overflow incontinence.
 As you get older, the muscles in your bladder and urethra lose some of their strength. Changes with age reduce how much your bladder can hold and increase the chances of involuntary urine release.
 Extra weight increases pressure on your bladder and surrounding muscles, which weakens them and allows urine to leak out when you cough or sneeze.
 Tobacco use may increase your risk of urinary incontinence.
 If a close family member has urinary incontinence, especially urge incontinence, your risk of developing the condition is higher.
 Neurological disease or diabetes may increase your risk of incontinence.
 Rashes, skin infections and sores can develop from constantly wet skin.
 Incontinence increases your risk of repeated urinary tract infections.
 Urinary incontinence can affect your social, work and personal relationships.
Maintain a healthy weight
Practice pelvic floor exercises
Avoid bladder irritants, such as caffeine, alcohol and acidic foods
Eat more fiber, which can prevent constipation, a cause of urinary incontinence
Don't smoke, or seek help to quit if you're a smoker

Bladder cancer,"Blood in urine (hematuria), which may cause urine to appear bright red or cola colored, though sometimes the urine appears normal and blood is detected on a lab test
Frequent urination
Painful urination
Back pain
 Urothelial carcinoma, previously called transitional cell carcinoma, occurs in the cells that line the inside of the bladder. Urothelial cells expand when your bladder is full and contract when your bladder is empty. These same cells line the inside of the ureters and the urethra, and cancers can form in those places as well. Urothelial carcinoma is the most common type of bladder cancer in the United States.
 Squamous cell carcinoma is associated with chronic irritation of the bladder — for instance, from an infection or from long-term use of a urinary catheter. Squamous cell bladder cancer is rare in the United States. It's more common in parts of the world where a certain parasitic infection (schistosomiasis) is a common cause of bladder infections.
 Adenocarcinoma begins in cells that make up mucus-secreting glands in the bladder. Adenocarcinoma of the bladder is very rare.
 Smoking cigarettes, cigars or pipes may increase the risk of bladder cancer by causing harmful chemicals to accumulate in the urine. When you smoke, your body processes the chemicals in the smoke and excretes some of them in your urine. These harmful chemicals may damage the lining of your bladder, which can increase your risk of cancer.
 Bladder cancer risk increases as you age. Though it can occur at any age, most people diagnosed with bladder cancer are older than 55.
 Men are more likely to develop bladder cancer than women are.
 Your kidneys play a key role in filtering harmful chemicals from your bloodstream and moving them into your bladder. Because of this, it's thought that being around certain chemicals may increase the risk of bladder cancer. Chemicals linked to bladder cancer risk include arsenic and chemicals used in the manufacture of dyes, rubber, leather, textiles and paint products.
 Treatment with the anti-cancer drug cyclophosphamide increases the risk of bladder cancer. People who received radiation treatments aimed at the pelvis for a previous cancer have a higher risk of developing bladder cancer.
 Chronic or repeated urinary infections or inflammations (cystitis), such as might happen with long-term use of a urinary catheter, may increase the risk of a squamous cell bladder cancer. In some areas of the world, squamous cell carcinoma is linked to chronic bladder inflammation caused by the parasitic infection known as schistosomiasis.
 If you've had bladder cancer, you're more likely to get it again. If one of your blood relatives — a parent, sibling or child — has a history of bladder cancer, you may have an increased risk of the disease, although it's rare for bladder cancer to run in families. A family history of Lynch syndrome, also known as hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), can increase the risk of cancer in the urinary system, as well as in the colon, uterus, ovaries and other organs.
 If you don't smoke, don't start. If you smoke, talk to your doctor about a plan to help you stop. Support groups, medications and other methods may help you quit.
 If you work with chemicals, follow all safety instructions to avoid exposure.
 Choose a diet rich in a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables. The antioxidants in fruits and vegetables may help reduce your risk of cancer.

Bipolar disorder," You've had at least one manic episode that may be preceded or followed by hypomanic or major depressive episodes. In some cases, mania may trigger a break from reality (psychosis).
 You've had at least one major depressive episode and at least one hypomanic episode, but you've never had a manic episode.
 You've had at least two years — or one year in children and teenagers — of many periods of hypomania symptoms and periods of depressive symptoms (though less severe than major depression).
 These include, for example, bipolar and related disorders induced by certain drugs or alcohol or due to a medical condition, such as Cushing's disease, multiple sclerosis or stroke.
Abnormally upbeat, jumpy or wired
Increased activity, energy or agitation
Exaggerated sense of well-being and self-confidence (euphoria)
Decreased need for sleep
Unusual talkativeness
Racing thoughts
Distractibility
Poor decision-making — for example, going on buying sprees, taking sexual risks or making foolish investments
Depressed mood, such as feeling sad, empty, hopeless or tearful (in children and teens, depressed mood can appear as irritability)
Marked loss of interest or feeling no pleasure in all — or almost all — activities
Significant weight loss when not dieting, weight gain, or decrease or increase in appetite (in children, failure to gain weight as expected can be a sign of depression)
Either insomnia or sleeping too much
Either restlessness or slowed behavior
Fatigue or loss of energy
Feelings of worthlessness or excessive or inappropriate guilt
Decreased ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness
Thinking about, planning or attempting suicide
 People with bipolar disorder appear to have physical changes in their brains. The significance of these changes is still uncertain but may eventually help pinpoint causes.
 Bipolar disorder is more common in people who have a first-degree relative, such as a sibling or parent, with the condition. Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing bipolar disorder.
Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with bipolar disorder

 Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse. You may have identified a pattern to your bipolar episodes and what triggers them. Call your doctor if you feel you're falling into an episode of depression or mania. Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs.
 Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more likely to come back.
 You may be tempted to stop treatment — but don't. Stopping your medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return.

 Damage to the kidneys from 
 buildup can raise blood pressure. And high blood pressure can do more damage to the kidneys.
 High levels of cholesterol can raise the risk of a heart attack.
 If the kidneys can't filter blood well enough due to buildup of 
, levels of waste products rise quickly in the blood. And if kidney function gets worse very quickly, health care professionals may use the term rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis.
 
 nephropathy can cause the kidneys to stop working over time. Then a treatment called dialysis or a kidney transplant is needed to live.
 This is a group of problems that can be caused by damage to the glomeruli. The problems can include high urine protein levels, low blood protein levels, high cholesterol and lipids, and swelling of the eyelids, feet and stomach area.

Botulism," The harmful bacteria thrive and make the toxin in environments with little oxygen, such as in home-canned food.
 If these bacteria get into a cut, they can cause a dangerous infection that makes the toxin.
 This most generic form of botulism begins after spores of C. botulinum bacteria grow in a baby's intestinal tract. It typically occurs in babies between the ages of 2 months and 8 months. In rare cases, this form of intestinal botulism also affects adults.

Narrowing of the urethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.
Scarring in the bladder neck due to past surgery.
Bladder or kidney stones.
Problems with nerves that control the bladder.
Cancer of the prostate or bladder.
Powerful pain-relieving medicines called opioids.
Cold and allergy medicines.
Older medicines for depression called tricyclic antidepressants.
 An enlarged prostate gland rarely causes symptoms before age 40. After that, the chance of having an enlarged prostate and related symptoms starts to rise.
 Having a blood relative with prostate problems makes you more likely to have problems with your prostate.
 Studies show that diabetes might raise the risk of 
. So might heart disease.
 Obesity raises the risk of 
. Exercise can help lower the risk.
 This also is called urinary retention. You might need to have a tube called a catheter placed into your bladder to drain the urine. Some people with an enlarged prostate need surgery to get relief.
 Not being able to fully empty the bladder can raise the risk of infection in the urinary tract. If you often get 
, you might need surgery to remove part of the prostate.
 These are most often caused by being unable to fully empty the bladder. Bladder stones can cause illness, bladder irritation, blood in the urine and blocked urine flow.
 A bladder that doesn't empty fully can stretch and weaken over time. As a result, the muscular wall of the bladder no longer squeezes properly to force urine out. And this makes it harder to fully empty the bladder.
 Pressure in the bladder from not being able to pee can damage the kidneys or let bladder infections reach the kidneys.

Irreversible damage to your facial nerve.
Irregular regrowth of nerve fibers. This may result in involuntary contraction of certain muscles when you're trying to move other muscles (synkinesis). For example, when you smile, the eye on the affected side may close.
Partial or complete blindness of the eye that won't close. This is caused by excessive dryness and scratching of the clear protective covering of the eye (cornea).
"
Geographic tongue,"Smooth, red, irregularly shaped patches on the top or side of your tongue. These patches may look like sores.
Frequent changes in the location, size and shape of the patches.
Pain or burning feeling in some cases, most often related to eating spicy or acidic foods.
 Some people with geographic tongue have a family history of it. So genetic factors may raise the risk.
 People with geographic tongue often have a condition called fissured tongue. This is when deep grooves, called fissures, appear on the surface of the tongue.
"
Behcet's disease," Painful mouth sores that look similar to canker sores are the most common sign of Behcet's disease. They begin as raised, round lesions in the mouth that quickly turn into painful ulcers. The sores usually heal in one to three weeks, though they do recur.
 Some people develop acnelike sores on their bodies. Others develop red, raised and tender nodules on their skin, especially on the lower legs.
 Red, open sores can occur on the scrotum or the vulva. The sores are usually painful and can leave scars.
 Inflammation in the eye (uveitis) causes redness, pain and blurred vision, typically in both eyes. In people with Behcet's disease, the condition can come and go.
 Joint swelling and pain often affect the knees in people with Behcet's disease. The ankles, elbows or wrists also might be involved. Signs and symptoms can last one to three weeks and go away on their own.
 Inflammation in veins and arteries can cause redness, pain, and swelling in the arms or legs when a blood clot results. Inflammation in the large arteries can lead to complications, such as aneurysms and narrowing or blockage of the vessel.
 A variety of signs and symptoms can affect the digestive system, including abdominal pain, diarrhea and bleeding.
 Inflammation in the brain and nervous system can cause headache, fever, disorientation, poor balance or stroke.
 Behcet's disease commonly affects men and women in their 20s and 30s, though children and older adults also can develop the condition.
 People from countries in the Middle East and East Asia, including Turkey, Iran, Japan and China, are more likely to develop Behcet's.
 While Behcet's disease occurs in both men and women, the disease is usually more severe in men.
 Having certain genes is associated with a higher risk of developing Behcet's.
"
Bed-wetting,"Your child still wets the bed after age 7.
Your child starts to wet the bed after a few months of being dry at night.
In addition to wetting the bed, your child has pain when passing urine, is often extra thirsty, has pink or red urine, has hard stools, or snores.
 Your child's bladder may not be developed enough to hold all the urine made during the night.
 If the nerves that control the bladder are slow to mature, a full bladder may not wake your child. This may be especially true if your child is a deep sleeper.
 During childhood, some kids do not produce enough anti-diuretic hormone, also called ADH. 
 slows down how much urine is made during the night.
 Also called a UTI, this infection can make it hard for your child to control the urge to pass urine. Symptoms may include bed-wetting, daytime accidents, passing urine often, red or pink urine, and pain when passing urine.
 Sometimes bed-wetting is a sign of obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is when a child's breathing is interrupted during sleep. This is often due to swollen and irritated or enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Other symptoms may include snoring and being sleepy during the day.
 For a child who's usually dry at night, bed-wetting may be the first sign of diabetes. Other symptoms may include passing large amounts of urine at once, increased thirst, extreme tiredness and weight loss in spite of a good appetite.
 A child who is constipated does not have bowel movements often enough, and the stools may be hard and dry. When constipation is long term, the muscles involved in passing urine and stools may not work well. This can be linked to bed-wetting.
 Rarely, bed-wetting is related to a difference in the structure of the urinary tract or nervous system.
 Stressful events may trigger bed-wetting. Examples include having a new baby in the family, starting a new school or sleeping away from home.
 If one or both of a child's parents wet the bed as children, their child has an increased chance of wetting the bed, too.
 Bed-wetting is more common in children who have 
.
Guilt and embarrassment, which can lead to low self-esteem.
Loss of opportunities for social activities, such as sleepovers and camp.
Rashes on your child's bottom and genital area — especially if your child sleeps in wet underwear.
"
Bee sting,"Instant, sharp burning pain at the sting site
A red welt at the sting area
Slight swelling around the sting area
Extreme redness
Swelling at the site of the sting that gradually enlarges over the next day or two
Skin reactions, including hives and itching and flushed or pale skin
Difficulty breathing
Swelling of the throat and tongue
A weak, rapid pulse
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Dizziness or fainting
Loss of consciousness
Nausea, vomiting or diarrhea
Headache
A feeling of spinning (vertigo)
Convulsions
Fever
Dizziness or fainting
Bee sting symptoms don't go away within a few days
You've had other symptoms of an allergic response to a bee sting
You live in an area where bees are especially active or with beehives nearby
Your work or hobbies require spending time outside
Take care when drinking sweet beverages outside. Wide, open cups may be your best option because you can see if a bee is in them. Inspect cans and straws before drinking from them.
Tightly cover food containers and trash cans.
Clear away garbage, fallen fruit, and dog or other animal feces (flies can attract wasps).
Wear closed-toe shoes when walking outside.
Don't wear bright colors or floral prints, which can attract bees.
Don't wear loose clothing, which can trap bees between the cloth and your skin.
When driving, keep your windows rolled up.
Be careful when mowing the lawn or trimming vegetation, activities that might arouse insects in a beehive or wasp nest.
Have hives and nests near your home removed by a professional.
If a few bees are flying around you, stay calm and slowly walk away from the area. Swatting at an insect may cause it to sting.
If a bee or wasp stings you, or many insects start to fly around, cover your mouth and nose and quickly leave the area. When a bee stings, it releases a chemical that attracts other bees. If you can, get into a building or closed vehicle.
"
Bedsores (pressure ulcers),"Unusual changes in skin color or texture
Swelling
Pus-like draining
An area of skin that feels cooler or warmer to the touch than other areas
Tender areas
Tailbone or buttocks
Shoulder blades and spine
Backs of arms and legs where they rest against the chair
The back or sides of the head
The shoulder blades
The hip, lower back or tailbone
The heels, ankles and skin behind the knees

    

    

    
 Friction occurs when the skin rubs against clothing or bedding. It can make fragile skin more vulnerable to injury, especially if the skin is also moist.
 Shear occurs when two surfaces move in the opposite direction. For example, when a bed is elevated at the head, you can slide down in bed. As the tailbone moves down, the skin over the bone might stay in place — essentially pulling in the opposite direction.
 This might be due to poor health, spinal cord injury and other causes.
 Skin becomes more vulnerable with extended exposure to urine and stool.
 Spinal cord injuries, neurological disorders and other conditions can result in a loss of sensation. An inability to feel pain or discomfort can result in not being aware of warning signs and the need to change position.
 People need enough fluids, calories, protein, vitamins and minerals in their daily diets to maintain healthy skin and prevent the breakdown of tissues.
 Health problems that can affect blood flow, such as diabetes and vascular disease, can increase the risk of tissue damage such as bedsores.
 Cellulitis is an infection of the skin and connected soft tissues. It can cause warmth, inflammation and swelling of the affected area. People with nerve damage often do not feel pain in the area affected by cellulitis.
 An infection from a pressure sore can burrow into joints and bones. Joint infections (septic arthritis) can damage cartilage and tissue. Bone infections (osteomyelitis) can reduce the function of joints and limbs.
 Long-term, nonhealing wounds (Marjolin's ulcers) can develop into a type of squamous cell carcinoma.
 
 Rarely, a skin ulcer leads to sepsis.
 Ask for help with repositioning about once an hour.
 If you have enough upper body strength, do wheelchair pushups — raising your body off the seat by pushing on the arms of the chair.
 Some wheelchairs allow you to tilt them, which can relieve pressure.
 Use cushions or a special mattress to relieve pressure and help ensure that your body is well positioned. Do not use doughnut cushions, as they can focus pressure on surrounding tissue.
 If your bed can be elevated at the head, raise it no more than 30 degrees. This helps prevent shearing.
 Wash the skin with a gentle cleanser and pat dry. Do this cleansing routine regularly to limit the skin's exposure to moisture, urine and stool.
 Use moisture barrier creams to protect the skin from urine and stool. Change bedding and clothing frequently if needed. Watch for buttons on the clothing and wrinkles in the bedding that irritate the skin.
 Look closely at your skin daily for warning signs of a pressure sore.
"
Ureteral obstruction,"Pain
Changes in how much urine you produce (urine output)
Difficulty urinating
Blood in the urine
Urinary tract infections
High blood pressure (hypertension)
Pain so severe that you can't sit still or find a comfortable position
Pain accompanied by nausea and vomiting
Pain accompanied by fever and chills
Blood in your urine
Difficulty passing urine
 This common condition, which is congenital, causes two ureters to form on the same kidney. The second ureter can be fully or only partially developed. If either ureter doesn't work properly, urine can back up into the kidney and cause damage.
 This prevents urine flow. A blockage where the ureter and kidney meet (ureteropelvic junction) may cause the kidney to swell and eventually stop working. This condition can be congenital or can develop with typical childhood growth, result from an injury or scarring, or in rare cases, develop from a tumor. A blockage where the ureter and bladder meet (ureterovesical junction) may cause urine to back up into the kidneys.
 If a ureter is too narrow and doesn't allow urine to flow completely, a tiny bulge in the ureter (ureterocele) may develop. When a ureterocele develops, it's usually in the section of the ureter closest to the bladder. This can block urine flow and cause urine to back up into the kidney, possibly leading to kidney damage.
 This rare disorder occurs when fibrous tissue grows in the area behind the abdomen. The fibers may grow as the result of cancer tumors or from taking certain medicines used to treat migraines. The fibers encircle and block the ureters, causing urine to back up into the kidneys.
Kidney stones
Cancerous and noncancerous tumors
Blood clots
Enlarged lymph nodes
Internal tissue growth, such as endometriosis in females
Long-term swelling of the ureter wall, usually due to diseases such as tuberculosis or a parasite infection called schistosomiasis
"
Barrett's esophagus,"Frequent heartburn and regurgitation of stomach contents
Difficulty swallowing food
Less commonly, chest pain
Have chest pain, which may be a symptom of a heart attack
Have difficulty swallowing
Are vomiting red blood or blood that looks like coffee grounds
Are passing black, tarry or bloody stools
Are unintentionally losing weight 
 Your odds of having Barrett's esophagus increase if you have a family history of Barrett's esophagus or esophageal cancer.
 Men are far more likely to develop Barrett's esophagus.
 White people have a greater risk of the disease than do people of other races.
 Barrett's esophagus can occur at any age but is more common in adults over 50.
 Having 
 that doesn't get better when taking medications known as proton pump inhibitors or having 
 that requires regular medication can increase the risk of Barrett's esophagus.
 Body fat around your abdomen further increases your risk.

 Women are more likely to be diagnosed with inflammatory breast cancer than are men — but men can develop inflammatory breast cancer, too.
 Inflammatory breast cancer is more frequently diagnosed in people in their 40s and 50s.
 Black women have a higher risk of inflammatory breast cancer than do white women.
 People who are obese have a greater risk of inflammatory breast cancer compared with those of normal weight.
"
Balance problems,"Sense of motion or spinning (vertigo)
Feeling of faintness or lightheadedness (presyncope)
Loss of balance or unsteadiness
Falling or feeling like you might fall
Feeling a floating sensation or dizziness
Vision changes, such as blurriness
Confusion
 
 occurs when calcium crystals in your inner ear — which help control your balance — are dislodged from their normal positions and move elsewhere in the inner ear. 
 is the most common cause of vertigo in adults. You might experience a spinning sensation when turning in bed or tilting your head back to look up.
 This inflammatory disorder, probably caused by a virus, can affect the nerves in the balance portion of your inner ear. Symptoms are often severe and persistent, and include nausea and difficulty walking. Symptoms can last several days and gradually improve without treatment. This is a common disorder second to 
 in adults.
 This disorder occurs frequently with other types of vertigo. Symptoms include unsteadiness or a sensation of motion in your head. Symptoms often worsen when you watch objects move, when you read or when you are in a visually complex environment such as a shopping mall. This is the third most common disorder in adults.
 In addition to sudden and severe vertigo, Meniere's disease can cause fluctuating hearing loss and buzzing, ringing or a feeling of fullness in your ear. The cause of Meniere's disease isn't fully known. Meniere's disease is rare and typically develops in people who are between the ages of 20 and 40.
 Dizziness and sensitivity to motion (vestibular migraine) can occur due to migraine. Migraine is a common cause of dizziness.
 This noncancerous (benign), slow-growing tumor develops on a nerve that affects your hearing and balance. You might experience dizziness or loss of balance, but the most common symptoms are hearing loss and ringing in your ear. Acoustic neuroma is a rare condition.
 Also known as herpes zoster oticus, this condition occurs when a shingles-like infection affects the facial, auditory and vestibular nerves near one of your ears. You might experience vertigo, ear pain, facial weakness and hearing loss.
 You might experience vertigo due to a concussion or other head injury.
 You might experience dizziness in boats, cars and airplanes, or on amusement park rides. Motion sickness is common in people with migraines.
 Standing or sitting up too quickly can cause some people to experience a significant drop in their blood pressure, resulting in feeling lightheaded or faint.
 Abnormal heart rhythms (heart arrhythmia), narrowed or blocked blood vessels, a thickened heart muscle (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), or a decrease in blood volume can reduce blood flow and cause lightheadedness or a fainting feeling.
 Abnormalities in your inner ear can cause a sensation of a floating or heavy head and unsteadiness in the dark.
 The damage can lead to difficulties with walking.
 Muscle weakness and unstable joints can contribute to your loss of balance. Difficulties with eyesight also can lead to unsteadiness.
 Loss of balance or unsteadiness can be a side effect of medications.
 These include cervical spondylosis and Parkinson's disease.
 Abnormalities of the vestibular system can lead to a sensation of floating or other false sensation of motion.
 Depression (major depressive disorder), anxiety and other psychiatric disorders can cause dizziness.
 This condition often accompanies anxiety disorders and may cause lightheadedness.
 Lightheadedness can be a side effect of medications.

Baker cyst,"Swelling behind the knee, and sometimes in the leg
Knee pain
Stiffness and inability to fully flex the knee
Inflammation of the knee joint, which can occur with various types of arthritis
A knee injury, such as a cartilage tear
Sharp pain in the knee
Swelling in the calf
Sometimes, redness of the calf or a feeling of water running down the calf
"
Bad breath," The breakdown of food particles in and around your teeth can lead to more bacteria and cause a foul odor. Eating certain foods, such as onions, garlic and spices, also can cause bad breath. After you digest these foods, they enter your bloodstream, are carried to your lungs and affect your breath.
 Smoking causes unpleasant mouth odor. Tobacco users also are more likely to have gum disease, which is another source of bad breath.
 If you don't brush and floss daily, food particles remain in your mouth, causing bad breath. A colorless, sticky film of bacteria called plaque forms on your teeth. If not brushed away, plaque can irritate your gums. Eventually, it can form plaque-filled pockets between your teeth and gums. The early stage of gum disease is known as gingivitis. Late-stage gum disease with bone loss is called periodontitis. Your tongue also can trap bacteria that produce odors. Dentures also can collect odor-causing bacteria and food particles, as can fixed or removable oral appliances such as braces that aren't cleaned regularly or don't fit properly.
 Saliva helps cleanse your mouth, removing particles that cause bad odors. A condition called dry mouth or xerostomia (zeer-o-STOE-me-uh) can be a part of bad breath because you produce less saliva. Dry mouth naturally occurs during sleep, leading to ""morning breath."" It gets worse if you sleep with your mouth open. Constant dry mouth can be caused by a problem with the glands that produce saliva and by some diseases.
 Some medicines can lead to bad breath by causing dry mouth. The body breaks down other medicines and releases chemicals that can be carried on your breath.
 Surgical wounds after mouth surgery, such as tooth removal, as well as tooth decay, gum disease or mouth sores, can cause bad breath.
 Small stones that form in the tonsils, called tonsil stones or tonsilloliths, are covered with bacteria that can cause bad breath. Infections, or constant swelling in the nose, sinuses or throat, can lead to postnasal drip. This is when fluid from your nose runs down the back of your throat. This condition also can cause bad breath.
 Diseases such as some cancers can cause a distinctive breath odor. The same is true for disorders related to the body's process of breaking food down into energy. Constant heartburn, which is a symptom of gastroesophageal reflux disease or GERD, can lead to bad breath. A foreign body, such as a piece of food lodged in a nostril, can cause bad breath in young children.

"
Back pain,"Lasts longer than a few weeks.
Is severe and doesn't improve with rest.
Spreads down one or both legs, especially if the pain goes below the knee.
Causes weakness, numbness, or tingling in one or both legs.
Is paired with unexplained weight loss.
Causes new bowel or bladder problems.
Is accompanied by a fever.
Follows a fall, blow to the back or other injury.
 Repeated heavy lifting or a sudden awkward movement can strain back muscles and spinal ligaments. For people in poor physical condition, constant strain on the back can cause painful muscle spasms.
 Disks act as cushions between the bones in the spine. The soft material inside a disk can bulge or rupture and press on a nerve. However, a bulging or ruptured disk might not cause back pain. Disk disease is often found on spine X-rays, 
 scans or 
 done for another reason.
 Osteoarthritis can affect the lower back. In some cases, arthritis in the spine can lead to a narrowing of the space around the spinal cord, a condition called spinal stenosis.
 The spine's vertebrae can develop painful breaks if the bones become porous and brittle.
 This inflammatory disease can cause some of the bones in the spine to fuse. This makes the spine less flexible.
 Back pain is more common with age, starting around age 30 or 40.
 Weak, unused muscles in the back and abdomen might lead to back pain.
 Excess body weight puts extra stress on the back.
 Some types of arthritis and cancer can contribute to back pain.
 Using the back instead of the legs can lead to back pain.
 People prone to depression and anxiety appear to have a greater risk of back pain. Stress can cause muscle tension, which can contribute to back pain.
 Smokers have increased rates of back pain. This may occur because smoking causes coughing, which can lead to herniated disks. Smoking also can decrease blood flow to the spine and increase the risk of osteoporosis.
 Regular low-impact aerobic activities — those that don't strain or jolt the back — can increase strength and endurance in the back and allow the muscles to work better. Walking, bicycling and swimming are good choices. Talk with your health care provider about which activities to try.
 Abdominal and back muscle exercises, which strengthen the core, help condition these muscles so that they work together to support the back.
 Being overweight strains back muscles.
 Smoking increases the risk of low back pain. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day, so quitting should help reduce this risk.
 Don't slouch. Maintain a neutral pelvic position. When standing for long periods, place one foot on a low footstool to take some of the load off the lower back. Alternate feet. Good posture can reduce the stress on back muscles.
 Choose a seat with good lower back support, armrests and a swivel base. Placing a pillow or rolled towel in the small of the back can maintain its normal curve. Keep knees and hips level. Change position frequently, at least every half-hour.
 Avoid heavy lifting, if possible. If you must lift something heavy, let your legs do the work. Keep your back straight — no twisting — and bend only at the knees. Hold the load close to your body. Find a lifting partner if the object is heavy or awkward.

Asthma,"Shortness of breath
Chest tightness or pain
Wheezing when exhaling, which is a common sign of asthma in children
Trouble sleeping caused by shortness of breath, coughing or wheezing
Coughing or wheezing attacks that are worsened by a respiratory virus, such as a cold or the flu
Asthma signs and symptoms that are more frequent and bothersome
Increasing difficulty breathing, as measured with a device used to check how well your lungs are working (peak flow meter)
The need to use a quick-relief inhaler more often
 which may be worse when the air is cold and dry
 triggered by workplace irritants such as chemical fumes, gases or dust
 triggered by airborne substances, such as pollen, mold spores, cockroach waste, or particles of skin and dried saliva shed by pets (pet dander)
Rapid worsening of shortness of breath or wheezing
No improvement even after using a quick-relief inhaler
Shortness of breath when you are doing minimal physical activity
 If you have frequent coughing or wheezing that lasts more than a few days or any other signs or symptoms of asthma, see your doctor. Treating asthma early may prevent long-term lung damage and help keep the condition from getting worse over time.
 If you know you have asthma, work with your doctor to keep it under control. Good long-term control helps you feel better from day to day and can prevent a life-threatening asthma attack.

    

    

    
 Asthma often changes over time. Meet with your doctor regularly to discuss your symptoms and make any needed treatment adjustments.
Airborne allergens, such as pollen, dust mites, mold spores, pet dander or particles of cockroach waste
Respiratory infections, such as the common cold
Physical activity
Cold air
Air pollutants and irritants, such as smoke
Certain medications, including beta blockers, aspirin, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve)
Strong emotions and stress
Sulfites and preservatives added to some types of foods and beverages, including shrimp, dried fruit, processed potatoes, beer and wine
Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), a condition in which stomach acids back up into your throat
Having a blood relative with asthma, such as a parent or sibling
Having another allergic condition, such as atopic dermatitis — which causes red, itchy skin — or hay fever — which causes a runny nose, congestion and itchy eyes
Being overweight
Being a smoker
Exposure to secondhand smoke
Exposure to exhaust fumes or other types of pollution
Exposure to occupational triggers, such as chemicals used in farming, hairdressing and manufacturing

Emergency room visits and hospitalizations for severe asthma attacks
Side effects from long-term use of some medications used to stabilize severe asthma

    

    

    
 Staying current with vaccinations can prevent flu and pneumonia from triggering asthma flare-ups.
 A number of outdoor allergens and irritants — ranging from pollen and mold to cold air and air pollution — can trigger asthma attacks. Find out what causes or worsens your asthma, and take steps to avoid those triggers.

    

    

    

    

    

    
 Don't change your medications without first talking to your doctor, even if your asthma seems to be improving. It's a good idea to bring your medications with you to each doctor visit. Your doctor can make sure you're using your medications correctly and taking the right dose.
 If you find yourself relying on your quick-relief inhaler, such as albuterol, your asthma isn't under control. See your doctor about adjusting your treatment.

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis," While your child might not complain of joint pain, you may notice that he or she limps — especially first thing in the morning or after a nap.
 Joint swelling is common but is often first noticed in larger joints such as the knee.
 You might notice that your child appears clumsier than usual, particularly in the morning or after naps.
 In some cases, high fever, swollen lymph nodes or a rash on the trunk may occur — which is usually worse in the evenings.

    

    

    
 Juvenile idiopathic arthritis can interfere with your child's growth and bone development. Some medications used for treatment, mainly corticosteroids, also can inhibit growth.

 This disease causes hardening and scarring of the bile ducts.
 Scarring of the liver caused by a history of chronic liver disease increases the risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
 People born with a choledochal cyst, which causes dilated and irregular bile ducts, have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
 In areas of Southeast Asia, cholangiocarcinoma is associated with liver fluke infection, which can occur from eating raw or undercooked fish.
 Cholangiocarcinoma occurs most often in adults over age 50.
 Smoking is associated with an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
 People who have type 1 or 2 diabetes may have an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma.
 Some DNA changes passed from parents to children cause conditions that increase the risk of cholangiocarcinoma. Examples of these conditions include cystic fibrosis and Lynch syndrome.
 Smoking is linked to an increased risk of cholangiocarcinoma. If you smoke, stop. If you have tried quitting in the past and haven't been successful, talk with your doctor about strategies to help you quit.

Fatigue, fever and loss of appetite
Skin
Eyes
Lungs
Heart
Kidneys
Salivary glands
Nerve tissue
Bone marrow
Blood vessels
 Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis.
 Rheumatoid arthritis can occur at any age, but it most commonly begins in middle age.
 If a member of your family has rheumatoid arthritis, you may have an increased risk of the disease.
 Cigarette smoking increases your risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, particularly if you have a genetic predisposition for developing the disease. Smoking also appears to be associated with greater disease severity.
 People who are overweight appear to be at a somewhat higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis.
 Rheumatoid arthritis itself, along with some medications used for treating rheumatoid arthritis, can increase your risk of osteoporosis — a condition that weakens your bones and makes them more prone to fracture.
 These firm bumps of tissue most commonly form around pressure points, such as the elbows. However, these nodules can form anywhere in the body, including the heart and lungs.
 People who have rheumatoid arthritis are much more likely to develop Sjogren's syndrome, a disorder that decreases the amount of moisture in the eyes and mouth.
 Rheumatoid arthritis itself and many of the medications used to combat it can impair the immune system, leading to increased infections. Protect yourself with vaccinations to prevent diseases such as influenza, pneumonia, shingles and COVID-19.
 The proportion of fat to lean mass is often higher in people who have rheumatoid arthritis, even in those who have a normal body mass index (BMI).
 If rheumatoid arthritis affects your wrists, the inflammation can compress the nerve that serves most of your hand and fingers.
 Rheumatoid arthritis can increase your risk of hardened and blocked arteries, as well as inflammation of the sac that encloses your heart.
 People with rheumatoid arthritis have an increased risk of inflammation and scarring of the lung tissues, which can lead to progressive shortness of breath.
 Rheumatoid arthritis increases the risk of lymphoma, a group of blood cancers that develop in the lymph system.
"
Gout," Gout usually affects the big toe, but it can occur in any joint. Other commonly affected joints include the ankles, knees, elbows, wrists and fingers. The pain is likely to be most severe within the first four to 12 hours after it begins.
 After the most severe pain subsides, some joint discomfort may last from a few days to a few weeks. Later attacks are likely to last longer and affect more joints.
 The affected joint or joints become swollen, tender, warm and red.
 As gout progresses, you may not be able to move your joints normally.
 Eating a diet rich in red meat and shellfish and drinking beverages sweetened with fruit sugar (fructose) increase levels of uric acid, which increase your risk of gout. Alcohol consumption, especially of beer, also increases the risk of gout.
 If you're overweight, your body produces more uric acid and your kidneys have a more difficult time eliminating uric acid.
 Certain diseases and conditions increase your risk of gout. These include untreated high blood pressure and chronic conditions such as diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and heart and kidney diseases.
 Low-dose aspirin and some medications used to control hypertension — including thiazide diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and beta blockers — also can increase uric acid levels. So can the use of anti-rejection drugs prescribed for people who have undergone an organ transplant.
 If other members of your family have had gout, you're more likely to develop the disease.
 Gout occurs more often in men, primarily because women tend to have lower uric acid levels. After menopause, however, women's uric acid levels approach those of men. Men are also more likely to develop gout earlier — usually between the ages of 30 and 50 — whereas women generally develop signs and symptoms after menopause.
 Experiencing recent surgery or trauma can sometimes trigger a gout attack. In some people, receiving a vaccination can trigger a gout flare.
 Some people may never experience gout signs and symptoms again. Others may experience gout several times each year. Medications may help prevent gout attacks in people with recurrent gout. If left untreated, gout can cause erosion and destruction of a joint.
 Untreated gout may cause deposits of urate crystals to form under the skin in nodules called tophi (TOE-fie). Tophi can develop in several areas, such as your fingers, hands, feet, elbows or Achilles tendons along the backs of your ankles. Tophi usually aren't painful, but they can become swollen and tender during gout attacks.
 Urate crystals may collect in the urinary tracts of people with gout, causing kidney stones. Medications can help reduce the risk of kidney stones.
"
Arthritis,"Pain
Stiffness
Swelling
Redness
Decreased range of motion
 Some types of arthritis run in families, so you may be more likely to develop arthritis if your parents or siblings have the disorder.
 The risk of many types of arthritis — including osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis and gout — increases with age.
 Women are more likely than men to develop rheumatoid arthritis, while most of the people who have gout, another type of arthritis, are men.
 People who have injured a joint, perhaps while playing a sport, are more likely to eventually develop arthritis in that joint.
 Carrying excess pounds puts stress on joints, particularly your knees, hips and spine. People with obesity have a higher risk of developing arthritis.
"
Giant cell arteritis,"Persistent, severe head pain, usually in your temple area
Scalp tenderness
Jaw pain when you chew or open your mouth wide
Fever
Fatigue
Unintended weight loss
Vision loss or double vision, particularly in people who also have jaw pain
Sudden, permanent loss of vision in one eye
 Giant cell arteritis affects adults only, and rarely those under 50. Most people with this condition develop signs and symptoms between the ages of 70 and 80.
 Women are about two times more likely to develop the condition than men are.
 Giant cell arteritis is most common among white people in Northern European populations or of Scandinavian descent.
 Having polymyalgia rheumatica puts you at increased risk of developing giant cell arteritis.
 Sometimes the condition runs in families.
 Diminished blood flow to your eyes can cause sudden, painless vision loss in one or, rarely, both eyes. Loss of vision is usually permanent.

    

    

    
 This is an uncommon complication of giant cell arteritis.

Arteriosclerosis / atherosclerosis," you may have chest pain or pressure (angina).
 you may have sudden numbness or weakness in your arms or legs, difficulty speaking or slurred speech, temporary loss of vision in one eye, or drooping muscles in your face. These signal a transient ischemic attack (TIA). Untreated, a 
 can lead to a stroke.
 you may have symptoms of peripheral artery disease, such as leg pain when walking (claudication) or decreased blood pressure in an affected limb.
 you may develop high blood pressure or kidney failure.

 When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your heart, you may develop coronary artery disease, which can cause chest pain (angina), a heart attack or heart failure.
 When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries close to your brain, you may develop carotid artery disease. This can cause a transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke.
 When atherosclerosis narrows the arteries in your arms or legs, you may develop blood flow problems in your arms and legs called peripheral artery disease. This can make you less sensitive to heat and cold, increasing your risk of burns or frostbite. Rarely, a lack of blood flow to the arms or legs can cause tissue death (gangrene).
 Atherosclerosis can also cause aneurysms, a serious complication that can occur anywhere in the body. Most people with aneurysms have no symptoms. Pain and throbbing in the area of an aneurysm may occur and is a medical emergency. If an aneurysm bursts, it can cause life-threatening bleeding inside the body.
 Atherosclerosis can cause the arteries leading to the kidneys to narrow. Narrowing of these arteries prevents enough oxygen-rich blood from reaching the kidneys. The kidneys need enough blood flow to help filter waste products and remove excess fluids.

Broken arm,"Severe pain, which might increase with movement
Swelling
Bruising
Deformity, such as a bent arm or wrist
Inability to turn your arm from palm up to palm down or vice versa
 Falling onto an outstretched hand or elbow is the most common cause of a broken arm.
 Direct blows and injuries on the field or court cause all types of arm fractures.
 Any of your arm bones can break during a car accident, bike accident or other direct trauma.
 In children, a broken arm might be the result of child abuse.
 Because a child's arm bones are still growing, a fracture in the area where growth occurs near each end of a long bone (growth plate) can interfere with that bone's growth.
 Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis there years later.
 The immobilization required to heal a fracture in the upper arm bone can sometimes result in painfully limited range of motion of the elbow or shoulder.
 If a part of your broken bone protrudes through your skin, it can be exposed to germs that can cause infection. Prompt treatment of this type of fracture is critical.
 If the upper arm bone (humerus) fractures into two or more pieces, the jagged ends can injure nearby nerves and blood vessels. Seek immediate medical attention if you notice numbness or circulation problems.
 Excessive swelling of the injured arm can cut off the blood supply to part of the arm, causing pain and numbness. Typically occurring 24 to 48 hours after the injury, compartment syndrome is a medical emergency that requires surgery.
 Eat a healthy diet that includes calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, and vitamin D, which helps your body absorb calcium. You can get vitamin D from fatty fish, such as salmon; from fortified foods, such as milk and orange juice; and from sun exposure.
 Weight-bearing physical activity and exercises that improve balance and posture can strengthen bones and reduce the chance of a fracture. The more active and fit you are as you age, the less likely you are to fall and break a bone.
 To prevent falling, wear sensible shoes. Remove home hazards that can cause you to trip, such as area rugs. Make sure your living space is well lit. Install grab bars in your bathroom and handrails on your stairways, if necessary.
 Wear wrist guards for high-risk activities, such as in-line skating, snowboarding, rugby and football.
 Smoking can increase your risk of a broken arm by reducing bone mass. It also hampers healing of fractures.

Chiari malformation,"Type 1
Type 2
Neck pain.
Unsteady walk and trouble with balance.
Poor hand coordination.
Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet.
Dizziness.
Trouble swallowing. This sometimes happens with gagging, choking and vomiting.
Speech changes, such as hoarseness.
Ringing or buzzing in the ears, known as tinnitus.

Quick downward eye movements.
Weakness in the arms.
 Hydrocephalus occurs when too much fluid builds up in the brain. This can cause trouble with thinking. People with hydrocephalus may need a flexible tube called a shunt placed. The shunt diverts and drains excess cerebrospinal fluid to a different area of the body.
 Spina bifida is a condition in which the spinal cord or its covering isn't fully developed. Part of the spinal cord is exposed, which can cause serious conditions such as paralysis. People with Chiari malformation type 2 usually have a form of spina bifida called myelomeningocele.
 Some people with Chiari malformation also develop a condition called syringomyelia. In people with this condition, a cavity or cyst called a syrinx forms within the spinal column. As the syrinx grows, it can press on the nerves and cause pain, weakness and stiffness.
 In this condition, the spinal cord attaches to the spine and causes the spinal cord to stretch. This can cause serious nerve and muscle damage in the lower body.
"
Heart arrhythmia,"Tachycardia (tak-ih-KAHR-dee-uh) is a fast heartbeat. The heart rate is greater than 100 beats a minute.
Bradycardia (brad-e-KAHR-dee-uh) is a slow heartbeat. The heart rate is less than 60 beats a minute.
 Chaotic heart signaling causes a rapid, uncoordinated heartbeat. 
 may be temporary and start and stop on its own. But some episodes may not stop unless treated. 
 has been linked to stroke.
 Atrial flutter is similar to 
, but the heartbeats are more organized. Atrial flutter also is linked to stroke.
 This broad term includes irregular heartbeats that start above the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. Supraventricular tachycardia causes episodes of a pounding heartbeat that start and stop suddenly.
 Rapid, chaotic electrical signals cause the lower heart chambers to quiver instead of squeezing in a coordinated way. This serious problem can lead to death if a regular heart rhythm isn't restored within minutes. Most people with ventricular fibrillation have an underlying heart disease or had a serious injury.
 This rapid, irregular heart rate starts with faulty electrical signals in the lower heart chambers, called the ventricles. The rapid heart rate doesn't let the ventricles properly fill with blood. So the heart may not be able to pump enough blood to the body. Ventricular tachycardia may not cause serious problems in people with otherwise healthy hearts. In those with heart disease, ventricular tachycardia can be an emergency that needs immediate medical care.
 The sinus node sets the pace of the heart. If the node doesn't work properly, the heart rate may switch between too slow and too fast. Sick sinus syndrome can be caused by scarring near the sinus node that slows, disrupts or blocks heartbeat signals. The condition is most common among older adults.
 A block of the heart's electrical pathways can cause the signals that trigger the heartbeats to slow down or stop. Some blocks may cause no symptoms. Others may cause skipped beats or  slowed heartbeats.
A fluttering, pounding or racing feeling in the chest.
A fast heartbeat.
A slow heartbeat.

Stress or anxiety.
 Narrowed heart arteries, a heart attack, heart valve disease, prior heart surgery, heart failure, cardiomyopathy and other heart damage are risk factors for almost any kind of arrhythmia.
 This condition increases the risk of developing coronary artery disease. It also may cause the walls of the left lower heart chamber to become stiff and thick, which can change how electrical signals travel through the heart.
 Also called congenital heart defects, some of these problems may affect the heart rate and rhythm.
 Having an overactive or underactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.
 This condition causes pauses in breathing during sleep. It can lead to a slow heartbeat and irregular heartbeats, including atrial fibrillation.
 Substances in the blood called electrolytes help trigger and send electrical signals in the heart. Potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium are examples of electrolytes. If the body's electrolytes are too low or too high, it may interfere with heart signaling and lead to irregular heartbeats.
 Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold treatments can cause arrhythmias.
 Drinking too much alcohol can affect electrical signaling in the heart. This can increase the chance of developing atrial fibrillation.
 Stimulants can cause the heart to beat faster and may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias. Illegal drugs, such as amphetamines and cocaine, may greatly affect the heart. Some may cause sudden death due to ventricular fibrillation.
Blood clots, which can lead to stroke.
Heart failure.

 Calcium deposits can build up on the aortic valve as you age. The buildup causes the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow. It prevents the valve from opening properly. Aortic stenosis also may prevent the valve from closing properly.
 This life-threatening condition also is called endocarditis. It's usually caused by an infection. It can damage the aortic valve.
 This condition was once a common childhood illness in the United States. Strep throat can cause it. Rheumatic fever can cause the aortic valve to become stiff and narrow, in turn causing blood to leak. If you have an irregular heart valve due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease.
 Other rare conditions can cause the aorta to get bigger and damage the aortic valve. These include a connective tissue disease called Marfan syndrome. Some immune system conditions, such as lupus, also can lead to aortic valve regurgitation.
 The body's main artery is the aorta. A traumatic chest injury may damage the aorta and cause aortic regurgitation. So might a tear in the inner layer of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.

 The aortic valve separates the lower left chamber (left ventricle) of the heart from the aorta. A bicuspid aortic valve has two flaps (cusps) instead of the usual three. Many people with coarctation of the aorta have a bicuspid aortic valve.
 A narrowing of the area below the aortic valve blocks blood flow from the lower left heart chamber to the aorta.
 The ductus arteriosus is a blood vessel that connects the left lung (pulmonary) artery to the aorta. When a baby is growing in the womb, this vessel lets blood go around the lungs. Shortly after birth, the ductus arteriosus usually closes. If it remains open, the opening is called a patent ductus arteriosus.
 Some people are born with a hole in the heart wall (septum) between the upper chambers (atrial septal defect) or the lower chambers (ventricular septal defect).This causes oxygen-rich blood from the left side of the heart to mix with oxygen-poor blood in the right side of the heart.
 This is a heart valve problem present at birth. The mitral valve is between the upper and lower left heart chambers. It lets blood flow through the left side of the heart. In mitral valve stenosis, the valve is narrowed, reducing blood flow. Symptoms include shortness of breath, difficulty breathing during exercise and shortness of breath when lying flat.
A weakened or bulging artery in the brain (brain aneurysm)
Bleeding in the brain (hemorrhage)
Aortic rupture or tear (dissection)

 Calcium can build up on the aortic valve as people age, causing the aortic valve to stiffen and become narrow.
 Some people are born with a missing, extra or fused valve flap. This increases the risk of aortic valve regurgitation.
 This complication of strep throat can cause aortic stenosis, a type of heart valve disease. If you have heart valve disease due to rheumatic fever, it's called rheumatic heart disease. If not, it's called nonrheumatic heart disease.
 This life-threatening condition is usually caused by infection. It can damage the aortic valve.
 Some types of cancer are treated with radiation therapy. Symptoms of heart valve disease may not be noticed until many years after radiation therapy is received.
 Chronic kidney disease, lupus and Marfan syndrome, a connective tissue disease, can increase the risk of aortic stenosis or regurgitation.
Blood clots.
Stroke.
Heart failure.
Heart rhythm problems, called arrhythmias.
Death due to sudden cardiac arrest.

 Anxiety disorders tend to run in families. However, it isn't entirely clear how much of this may be due to genetics and how much is due to learned behavior.
 A structure in the brain called the amygdala (uh-MIG-duh-luh) may play a role in controlling the fear response. People who have an overactive amygdala may have a heightened fear response, causing increased anxiety in social situations.
 Social anxiety disorder may be a learned behavior — some people may develop significant anxiety after an unpleasant or embarrassing social situation. Also, there may be an association between social anxiety disorder and parents who either model anxious behavior in social situations or are more controlling or overprotective of their children.
 You're more likely to develop social anxiety disorder if your biological parents or siblings have the condition.
 Children who experience teasing, bullying, rejection, ridicule or humiliation may be more prone to social anxiety disorder. In addition, other negative events in life, such as family conflict, trauma or abuse, may be associated with this disorder.
 Children who are shy, timid, withdrawn or restrained when facing new situations or people may be at greater risk.
 Social anxiety disorder symptoms typically start in the teenage years, but meeting new people, giving a speech in public or making an important work presentation may trigger symptoms for the first time.
 For example, facial disfigurement, stuttering or tremors due to Parkinson's disease can increase feelings of self-consciousness and may trigger social anxiety disorder in some people.
Low self-esteem
Trouble being assertive
Negative self-talk
Hypersensitivity to criticism
Poor social skills
Isolation and difficult social relationships

 Keeping track of your personal life can help you and your mental health professional identify what's causing you stress and what seems to help you feel better.
 You can reduce anxiety by carefully managing your time and energy. Make sure that you spend time doing things you enjoy.
 Alcohol and drug use and even caffeine or nicotine use can cause or worsen anxiety. If you're addicted to any of these substances, quitting can make you anxious. If you can't quit on your own, see your health care provider or find a treatment program or support group to help you.

 Women who have had a vaginal or instrument-assisted delivery, multiple pregnancies, or whose infants had a high birth weight have a higher risk of anterior prolapse.
 Your risk of anterior prolapse increases as you age. This is especially true after menopause, when your body's production of estrogen — which helps keep the pelvic floor strong — decreases.
 Having your uterus removed may contribute to weakness in your pelvic floor, but this is not always the case.
 Some women are born with weaker connective tissues, making them more susceptible to anterior prolapse.
 Women who are overweight or obese are at higher risk of anterior prolapse.

"
Bacterial vaginosis,"Thin, vaginal discharge that may be gray, white or green.
Foul-smelling, ""fishy"" vaginal odor.
Vaginal itching.
Burning during urination.
Your vaginal discharge smells unusual and you have discomfort. Your doctor can help find the cause of your symptoms.
You've had vaginal infections before but your discharge seems different this time.
You have a new sex partner or different sex partners. Sometimes, the symptoms of a sexually transmitted infection (STI) are the same as those of bacterial vaginosis.
You thought you had a yeast infection but still have symptoms after self-treatment.
 The link between having sex and bacterial vaginosis isn't clear. But 
 happens more often when someone has different or new sex partners. Also, 
 is more common when the sex of both partners is female.
 The vagina is self-cleaning. So rinsing your vagina with water or something else isn't needed. It may even cause problems. Douching upsets the vagina's healthy balance of bacteria. It can lead to an overgrowth of anaerobic bacteria, causing bacterial vaginosis.
 If your vagina doesn't produce enough lactobacilli, you're more likely to develop bacterial vaginosis.
 If you have

 Having 
 may increase the risk of developing an infection after surgery such as hysterectomy or dilation and curettage (D&C).
 Bacterial vaginosis can sometimes cause 
. This infection of the uterus and the fallopian tubes raises the risk of infertility.
 Past studies have shown a possible link between 
 and problems with pregnancy. These include preterm birth and low birth weight. New studies show that these risks may be due to other reasons. These reasons include having a history of early delivery. But the studies agree that you should be tested if you notice symptoms of 
 while pregnant. If positive, your doctor can choose the best treatment for you.
 Wash your genitals with warm water only. Scented soaps and other scented products may inflame vaginal tissues. Use unscented tampons or pads only.
 Douching won't clear up a vaginal infection. It may even make it worse. Your vagina doesn't require cleansing other than normal bathing. Douching disrupts the vaginal flora, raising your risk of infection.
 To lower your risk of 
s, use latex condoms or dental dams. Clean any sex toys. Limit your number of sex partners or don't have sex.

 Although it's not yet clear which genes are involved, there may be genetic changes that make some people at higher risk of developing anorexia. Some people may have a genetic tendency toward perfectionism, sensitivity and perseverance — all traits associated with anorexia.
 Some people with anorexia may have obsessive-compulsive personality traits that make it easier to stick to strict diets and forgo food despite being hungry. They may have an extreme drive for perfectionism, which causes them to think they're never thin enough. And they may have high levels of anxiety and engage in restrictive eating to reduce it.
 Modern Western culture emphasizes thinness. Success and worth are often equated with being thin. Peer pressure may help fuel the desire to be thin, particularly among young girls.
 Changes in specific genes may put certain people at higher risk of anorexia. Those with a first-degree relative — a parent, sibling or child — who had the disorder have a much higher risk of anorexia.
 Dieting is a risk factor for developing an eating disorder. There is strong evidence that many of the symptoms of anorexia are actually symptoms of starvation. Starvation affects the brain and influences mood changes, rigidity in thinking, anxiety and reduction in appetite. Starvation and weight loss may change the way the brain works in vulnerable individuals, which may perpetuate restrictive eating behaviors and make it difficult to return to normal eating habits.
 Whether it's a new school, home or job; a relationship breakup; or the death or illness of a loved one, change can bring emotional stress and increase the risk of anorexia.

Tongue-tie (ankyloglossia),"Difficulty lifting the tongue to the upper teeth or moving the tongue from side to side
Trouble sticking out the tongue past the lower front teeth
A tongue that appears notched or heart shaped when stuck out
Your baby has signs of tongue-tie that cause problems, such as having trouble breast-feeding
A speech-language pathologist thinks your child's speech is affected by tongue-tie
Your older child complains of tongue problems that interfere with eating, speaking or reaching the back teeth
You're bothered by your own symptoms of tongue-tie
 Breast-feeding requires a baby to keep his or her tongue over the lower gum while sucking. If unable to move the tongue or keep it in the right position, the baby might chew instead of suck on the nipple. This can cause significant nipple pain and interfere with a baby's ability to get breast milk. Ultimately, poor breast-feeding can lead to inadequate nutrition and failure to thrive.
 Tongue-tie can interfere with the ability to make certain sounds — such as ""t,"" ""d,"" ""z,"" ""s,"" ""th,"" ""r"" and ""l.""
 For an older child or adult, tongue-tie can make it difficult to sweep food debris from the teeth. This can contribute to tooth decay and inflammation of the gums (gingivitis). Tongue-tie can also lead to the formation of a gap or space between the two bottom front teeth.
 Tongue-tie can interfere with activities such as licking an ice cream cone, licking the lips, kissing or playing a wind instrument.

 Ankle sprains are a common sports injury, particularly in sports that require jumping, cutting action, or rolling or twisting of the foot such as basketball, tennis, football, soccer and trail running.
 Walking or running on uneven surfaces or poor field conditions may increase the risk of an ankle sprain.
 Once you've sprained your ankle or had another type of ankle injury, you're more likely to sprain it again.
 Poor strength or flexibility in the ankles may increase the risk of a sprain when participating in sports.
 Shoes that don't fit properly or aren't appropriate for an activity, as well as high-heeled shoes in general, make ankles more vulnerable to injury.

 Many medications may cause hives or angioedema, including penicillins, aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others), naproxen sodium (Aleve) and blood pressure medications.
 Pollen and other allergens that you breathe in can trigger hives, sometimes accompanied by upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms.
 Other causes of acute hives and angioedema are insect bites and infections.
Have had hives or angioedema before
Have had other allergic reactions
Have a family history of hives, angioedema or hereditary angioedema
 If you know what has triggered your hives, try to avoid that substance.

Vasculitis,"Fever
Headache
Fatigue
Weight loss
General aches and pains
 If your stomach or intestines are affected, you may experience pain after eating. Ulcers and perforations are possible and may result in blood in the stool.
 Dizziness, ringing in the ears and abrupt hearing loss may occur.
 Vasculitis can make your eyes look red and itch or burn. Giant cell arteritis can cause double vision and temporary or permanent blindness in one or both eyes. This is sometimes the first sign of the disease.
 Some types of vasculitis can cause numbness or weakness in a hand or foot. The palms of the hands and soles of the feet might swell or harden.
 You may develop shortness of breath or even cough up blood if vasculitis affects your lungs.
 Bleeding under the skin can show up as red spots. Vasculitis can also cause lumps or open sores on your skin.
Infections, such as hepatitis B and hepatitis C
Blood cancers
Immune system diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, lupus and scleroderma
Reactions to certain drugs
 Giant cell arteritis rarely occurs before the age of 50, while Kawasaki disease is most common in children younger than 5 years old.
 Behcet's disease, granulomatosis with polyangiitis and Kawasaki disease sometimes run in families.
 Using cocaine can increase your risk of developing vasculitis. Smoking tobacco, especially if you're a man younger than 45, can increase your risk of Buerger's disease.
 Vasculitis can sometimes be triggered by medications such as hydralazine, allopurinol, minocycline and propylthiouracil.
 Having hepatitis B or C can increase your risk of vasculitis.
 People who have disorders in which their immune systems mistakenly attack their own bodies may be at higher risk of vasculitis. Examples include lupus, rheumatoid arthritis and scleroderma.
 Giant cell arteritis is much more common in women, while Buerger's disease is more common in men.
 Some types of vasculitis can be severe, causing damage to major organs.
 A blood clot may form in a blood vessel, obstructing blood flow. Rarely, vasculitis will cause a blood vessel to weaken and bulge, forming an aneurysm (AN-yoo-riz-um).
 This is a possible complication of untreated giant cell arteritis.
 Some of the medications used to treat vasculitis may weaken your immune system. This can make you more prone to infections.

 Plaque buildup on the artery walls causes the arteries to become less flexible. Additional pressure can cause the arteries to weaken and widen. High blood pressure and high cholesterol increase the risk of atherosclerosis. This is more common in older people.

    

    

    
 Conditions that involve blood vessel inflammation, such as giant cell arteritis and Takayasu arteritis, are associated with thoracic aortic aneurysms.
 The aortic valve is between the lower left heart chamber and the aorta. People who are born with an aortic valve that has only two flaps instead of three have an increased risk of a thoracic aneurysm.
 Though rare, it's possible to develop a thoracic aortic aneurysm if you've had an untreated infection, such as syphilis or salmonella.
 Rarely, some people who are injured in falls or motor vehicle crashes develop thoracic aortic aneurysms.
 Growing older increases the risk of aortic aneurysms. Thoracic aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.
 Smoking and using tobacco greatly increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm.
 Increased blood pressure damages the blood vessels in the body, raising the risk of an aneurysm.
 The buildup of fat and other substances in the blood can damage the lining of a blood vessel, increasing the risk of an aneurysm. This is a more common risk in older people.
 Having a parent, brother, sister or child with an aortic aneurysm increases the risk of an aortic aneurysm and rupture. You may develop aneurysms at a younger age.
 If you have Marfan syndrome or a related condition, such as Loeys-Dietz syndrome or vascular Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, you have a significantly higher risk of a thoracic aortic aneurysm. The risk also is increased for an aortic or other blood vessel dissection or rupture.
 Having an aortic valve with two cusps instead of three increases the risk of aortic aneurysm.
 This is called internal bleeding. Emergency surgery is required to try to prevent death.
 Small blood clots can develop in the area of the aortic aneurysm. If a blood clot breaks loose from the inside wall of an aneurysm, it can block a blood vessel elsewhere in the body. This can possibly cause serious complications.
 Signs and symptoms of stroke include weakness of or an inability to move one side of the body. It may be difficult to speak.
Don't smoke or use tobacco products.
Keep blood pressure and cholesterol levels under control.
Get regular exercise.

 Difficulty coordinating sucking and swallowing may cause feeding problems in infants. Your pediatrician may recommend a high-calorie formula to help your baby gain weight.
 Children with Angelman syndrome often move quickly from one activity to another, have a short attention span, and keep their hands or a toy in their mouths. Hyperactivity often decreases with age, and medication usually isn't necessary.
 People with Angelman syndrome often have abnormal sleep-wake patterns and may require less sleep than most people. Sleep difficulties may improve with age. Medication and behavior therapy may help control sleep disorders.
 Some people with Angelman syndrome develop an abnormal side-to-side spinal curvature over time.
 Older children with Angelman syndrome tend to have large appetites, which may lead to obesity.

Angina,"
    

    

    
 Unstable angina is unpredictable and occurs at rest. Or the angina pain is worsening and occurs with less physical effort. It's typically severe and lasts longer than stable angina, maybe 20 minutes or longer. The pain doesn't go away with rest or the usual angina medications. If the blood flow doesn't improve, the heart is starved of oxygen and a heart attack occurs. Unstable angina is dangerous and requires emergency treatment.
 Variant angina, also called Prinzmetal angina, isn't due to coronary artery disease. It's caused by a spasm in the heart's arteries that temporarily reduces blood flow. Severe chest pain is the main symptom of variant angina. It most often occurs in cycles, typically at rest and overnight. The pain may be relieved by angina medication.
 Angina episodes are frequent despite a combination of medications and lifestyle changes.

Pressure
Squeezing
Dizziness
Fatigue
Nausea

 Angina is most common in adults age 60 and older.
 Tell your health care provider if your mother, father or any siblings have or had heart disease or a heart attack.
 Smoking, chewing tobacco and long-term exposure to secondhand smoke can damage the lining of the arteries, allowing deposits of cholesterol to collect and block blood flow.
 Diabetes increases the risk of coronary artery disease, which leads to angina and heart attacks by speeding up atherosclerosis and increasing cholesterol levels.
 Over time, high blood pressure damages arteries by accelerating hardening of the arteries.
 Too much bad cholesterol — low-density lipoprotein (LDL) — in the blood can cause arteries to narrow. A high 
 increases the risk of angina and heart attacks. A high level of triglycerides in the blood also is unhealthy.
 Chronic kidney disease, peripheral artery disease, metabolic syndrome or a history of stroke increases the risk of angina.
 An inactive lifestyle contributes to high cholesterol, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and obesity. Talk to your health care provider about the type and amount of exercise that's best for you.
 Obesity is a risk factor for heart disease, which can cause angina. Being overweight makes the heart work harder to supply blood to the body.
 Too much stress and anger can raise blood pressure. Surges of hormones produced during stress can narrow the arteries and worsen angina.
 Drugs that tighten blood vessels, such as some migraine drugs, may trigger Prinzmetal's angina.
 Cocaine and other stimulants can cause blood vessel spasms and trigger angina.
 Exposure to cold temperatures can trigger Prinzmetal angina.
Pressure, fullness or a squeezing pain in the center of the chest that lasts for more than a few minutes

The body doesn't make enough hemoglobin or red blood cells.
Bleeding causes loss of red blood cells and hemoglobin faster than they can be replaced.
The body destroys red blood cells and the hemoglobin that's in them.

    


 Diseases that cause ongoing inflammation can keep the body from making enough red blood cells. Examples are cancer, HIV/AIDS, rheumatoid arthritis, kidney disease and Crohn's disease.
 This rare, life-threatening anemia occurs when the body doesn't make enough new blood cells. Causes of aplastic anemia include infections, certain medicines, autoimmune diseases and being in contact with toxic chemicals.
 Diseases such as leukemia and myelofibrosis can affect how the bone marrow makes blood. The effects of these types of diseases range from mild to life-threatening.
 This group of anemias is from red blood cells being destroyed faster than bone marrow can replace them. Certain blood diseases increase how fast red blood cells are destroyed. Some types of hemolytic anemia can be passed through families, which is called inherited.
 This inherited and sometimes serious condition is a type of hemolytic anemia. An unusual hemoglobin forces red blood cells into an unusual crescent shape, called a sickle. These irregular blood cells die too soon. That causes an ongoing shortage of red blood cells.
 Not getting enough iron, vitamin B-12 and folate increases the risk of anemia.
 Having a condition that affects how the small intestine takes in nutrients increases the risk of anemia. Examples are Crohn's disease and celiac disease.
 In general, having heavy periods can create a risk of anemia. Having periods causes the loss of red blood cells.
 Pregnant people who don't take a multivitamin with folic acid and iron are at an increased risk of anemia.

    
 Having a family member with a type of anemia passed through families, called inherited, can increase the risk of inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia.
 A history of certain infections, blood diseases and autoimmune conditions increases the risk of anemia. Drinking too much alcohol, being around toxic chemicals, and taking some medicines can affect the making of red blood cells and lead to anemia.
 People over age 65 are at increased risk of anemia.
 Severe anemia can make it impossible to do everyday tasks.
 Pregnant people with folate deficiency anemia may be more likely to have complications, such as premature birth.
 Anemia can lead to a rapid or irregular heartbeat, called arrhythmia. With anemia, the heart must pump more blood to make up for too little oxygen in the blood. This can lead to an enlarged heart or heart failure.
 Some inherited anemias, such as sickle cell anemia, can lead to life-threatening complications. Losing a lot of blood quickly causes severe anemia and can be fatal.
 Iron-rich foods include beef and other meats, beans, lentils, iron-fortified cereals, dark green leafy vegetables, and dried fruit.
 This nutrient, and its human-made form folic acid, can be found in fruits and fruit juices, dark green leafy vegetables, green peas, kidney beans, peanuts, and enriched grain products, such as bread, cereal, pasta and rice.
 Foods rich in vitamin B-12 include meat, dairy products, and fortified cereals and soy products.
 Foods rich in vitamin C include citrus fruits and juices, peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, melons, and strawberries. These also help the body take in iron.
"
Brain aneurysm," This type of aneurysm looks like a berry hanging from a vine. It's a round, blood-filled sac that protrudes from the main artery or one of its branches. It usually forms on arteries at the base of the brain. A berry aneurysm is the most common type of aneurysm.
 This type of aneurysm causes bulging on all sides of the artery.
 This type of aneurysm is caused by an infection. When an infection affects the arteries in the brain, it can weaken the artery wall. This can cause an aneurysm to form.
Nausea and vomiting
Stiff neck
Blurred or double vision
Sensitivity to light

Numbness of one side of the face.
Sudden, extremely severe headache
 Brain aneurysms can occur at any age. However, they're more common in adults between ages 30 and 60.
 Brain aneurysms are more common in women than in men.
 Smoking is a risk factor for brain aneurysms to form and for brain aneurysms to rupture.
 This condition
can weaken arteries. Aneurysms are more likely to form and to rupture in weakened arteries.
 Drug use raises blood pressure. If illicit drugs are used intravenously, it can lead to an infection. An infection can cause a mycotic aneurysm.
 This also can increase blood pressure.
 such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. These disorders weaken blood vessels.
 This inherited disorder results in fluid-filled sacs in the kidneys. It also may increase blood pressure.
 The aorta is the large blood vessel that delivers oxygen-rich blood from the heart to the body.
 In this condition, arteries and veins in the brain are tangled. This affects blood flow.
 Your risk is higher if you have family members who have had a brain aneurysm. This is particularly true if two or more first-degree relatives — such as a parent, brother, sister or child — has had a brain aneurysm. If you have a family history, you can ask your health care provider about getting screened for a brain aneurysm.
Having a large aneurysm.
Having aneurysms in certain locations.
Smoking cigarettes.
Having untreated high blood pressure.
 An aneurysm that has ruptured or has leaked is at risk of bleeding again. Re-bleeding can cause further damage to brain cells.
 After a brain aneurysm ruptures, blood vessels in the brain may contract and narrow. This is known as vasospasm. Vasospasm can cause an ischemic stroke, in which there's limited blood flow to brain cells. This may cause additional cell damage and loss.
 Most often, a ruptured brain aneurysm occurs in the space between the brain and the thin tissues covering the brain. The blood can block the movement of fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. As a result, an excess of fluid puts pressure on the brain and can damage tissues.
 Bleeding in the brain can disrupt the balance of sodium in the blood. This may occur from damage to the hypothalamus, an area near the base of the brain. A drop in blood sodium levels can lead to swelling of brain cells and permanent damage.
"
Anal itching,"Anal itching is severe or constant
You have anal bleeding or stool leakage
The anal area seems to be infected
You can't figure out what's causing a constant itch
 Fecal incontinence and long-term diarrhea can irritate the skin. Or your skin care routine may include products or behaviors that irritate the skin. Examples include using harsh soaps or wiping too hard and too often.
 These include sexually transmitted infections, pinworm infections and yeast infections.
 Sometimes anal itching is the result of a specific skin condition, such as dry skin, psoriasis or contact dermatitis.
 These include diabetes, thyroid disease and hemorrhoids.

 Straining during bowel movements and passing hard stools increase the risk of tearing.
 Anal fissures are more common in women after they give birth.
 This inflammatory bowel disease causes chronic inflammation of the intestinal tract. This may make the lining of the anal canal more vulnerable to tearing.
 Anal fissures can occur at any age, but are more common in infants and middle-aged adults.
 An anal fissure that fails to heal within eight weeks is considered chronic and may need further treatment.
 Once you've experienced an anal fissure, you are prone to having another one.
 An anal fissure may extend into the ring of muscle that holds your anus closed. This muscle is called the internal anal sphincter. If this happens, it makes it more difficult for your anal fissure to heal. An unhealed fissure may trigger a cycle of discomfort that may require medicines or surgery to reduce the pain and to repair or remove the fissure.

 People who have receptive anal sex have an increased risk of anal cancer.
 People who smoke cigarettes have an increased risk of anal cancer.
 Those who have had cervical, vulvar or vaginal cancer have an increased risk of anal cancer.
 If the body's germ-fighting immune system is weakened by medicines or illness, there might be a higher risk of anal cancer. People with a weakened immune system include those taking medicines to control the immune system, such as after an organ transplant. Certain medical conditions, such as infection with 
, also can weaken the immune system.
 Reduce your risk of anal cancer by taking measures to prevent sexually transmitted infections. This may include using a condom every time you have sex and limiting the number of sexual partners you have.
 Receiving a vaccination to prevent 
 infection may reduce your risk of anal cancer and other

Shortness of breath
Numbness, tingling, or pain in the hands or feet
Swelling of the ankles and legs
Diarrhea, possibly with blood, or constipation
An enlarged tongue, which sometimes looks rippled around its edge
Skin changes, such as thickening or easy bruising, and purplish patches around the eyes
 This is the most common type of amyloidosis in developed countries. 
 is also called primary amyloidosis. It usually affects the heart, kidneys, liver and nerves.
 This type is also known as secondary amyloidosis. It's usually triggered by an inflammatory disease, such as rheumatoid arthritis. It most commonly affects the kidneys, liver and spleen.
 This inherited disorder often affects the nerves, heart and kidneys. It most commonly happens when a protein made by your liver is abnormal. This protein is called transthyretin (TTR).
 This variety has also been called senile systemic amyloidosis. It occurs when the 
 protein made by the liver is normal but produces amyloid for unknown reasons. Wild-type amyloidosis tends to affect men over age 70 and often targets the heart. It can also cause carpal tunnel syndrome.
 This type of amyloidosis often has a better prognosis than the varieties that affect multiple organ systems. Typical sites for localized amyloidosis include the bladder, skin, throat or lungs. Correct diagnosis is important so that treatments that affect the entire body can be avoided.
 Most people diagnosed with amyloidosis are between ages 60 and 70.
 Amyloidosis occurs more commonly in men.
 Having a chronic infectious or inflammatory disease increases the risk of AA amyloidosis.
 Some types of amyloidosis are hereditary.
 Dialysis can't always remove large proteins from the blood. If you're on dialysis, abnormal proteins can build up in your blood and eventually be deposited in tissue. This condition is less common with more modern dialysis techniques.
 People of African descent appear to be at higher risk of carrying a genetic mutation associated with a type of amyloidosis that can harm the heart.
 Amyloid reduces the heart's ability to fill with blood between heartbeats. Less blood is pumped with each beat. This can cause shortness of breath. If amyloidosis affects the heart's electrical system, it can cause heart rhythm problems. Amyloid-related heart problems can become life-threatening.
 Amyloid can harm the kidneys' filtering system. This affects their ability to remove waste products from the body. It can eventually cause kidney failure.
 Nerve damage can cause pain, numbness, or tingling of the fingers and feet. If amyloid affects the nerves that control bowel function, it can cause periods of alternating constipation and diarrhea. Damage to the nerves that control blood pressure can make people feel faint if they stand up too quickly.

Ameloblastoma," This is the most common type and grows aggressively, usually in the lower jawbone, and approximately 10% recur after treatment.
 This type is less aggressive, but typically occurs at a younger age. The tumor is often in the back of the lower jawbone at the molars. Recurrence is possible after treatment.
 This type is rare and affects the gums and oral tissue in the upper or lower jaw. The tumor has a low risk of recurrence after treatment.
 This type is very rare and is defined by tumor cells that occur away from the primary site in the jaw.

 Excessively low body weight — about 10% under normal weight — interrupts many hormonal functions in the body, potentially halting ovulation. Women who have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, often stop having periods because of these abnormal hormonal changes.
 Women who participate in activities that require rigorous training, such as ballet, may find their menstrual cycles interrupted. Several factors combine to contribute to the loss of periods in athletes, including low body fat, stress and high energy expenditure.
 Mental stress can temporarily alter the functioning of your hypothalamus — an area of your brain that controls the hormones that regulate your menstrual cycle. Ovulation and menstruation may stop as a result. Regular menstrual periods usually resume after your stress decreases.
 
 causes relatively high and sustained levels of hormones, rather than the fluctuating levels seen in the normal menstrual cycle.
 An overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) or underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) can cause menstrual irregularities, including amenorrhea.
 A noncancerous (benign) tumor in your pituitary gland can interfere with the hormonal regulation of menstruation.
 Menopause usually begins around age 50. But, for some women, the ovarian supply of eggs diminishes before age 40 and menstruation stops.
 Asherman's syndrome, a condition in which scar tissue builds up in the lining of the uterus, can sometimes occur after a dilation and curettage (D&C), cesarean section or treatment for uterine fibroids. Uterine scarring prevents the normal buildup and shedding of the uterine lining.
 Sometimes problems arise during fetal development that lead to missing parts of the reproductive system, such as the uterus, cervix or vagina. Because the reproductive system didn't develop fully, menstrual cycles aren't possible later in life.
 An obstruction of the vagina may prevent visible menstrual bleeding. A membrane or wall may be present in the vagina that blocks the outflow of blood from the uterus and cervix.
 If other women in your family have experienced amenorrhea, you may have inherited a predisposition for the problem.
 If you have an eating disorder, such as anorexia or bulimia, you are at higher risk of developing amenorrhea.
 Rigorous athletic training can increase your risk of amenorrhea.
 If you've had a 
, especially related to pregnancy, or a procedure known as loop electrodiathermy excision procedure (LEEP), your risk of developing amenorrhea is higher.
 If you don't ovulate and don't have menstrual periods, you can't become pregnant. When hormone imbalance is the cause of amenorrhea, this can also cause miscarriage or other problems with pregnancy.
 Not having periods when your peers are having theirs can be stressful, especially for young people who are transitioning into adulthood.
 These two problems can be caused by not having enough estrogen. Osteoporosis is a weakening of the bones. Cardiovascular disease includes heart attack and problems with the blood vessels and heart muscle.
 If an anatomical problem is causing the amenorrhea, it may also cause pain in the pelvic area.
"
Ambiguous genitalia,"An enlarged clitoris, which may resemble a penis
Closed labia, or labia that include folds and resemble a scrotum
Lumps that feel like testes in the fused labia
A condition in which the narrow tube that carries urine and semen (urethra) doesn't fully extend to the tip of the penis (hypospadias)
An abnormally small penis with the urethral opening closer to the scrotum
The absence of one or both testicles in what appears to be the scrotum
Undescended testicles and an empty scrotum that has the appearance of a labia with or without a micropenis
In males, a region on the Y chromosome triggers the development of testicles, which produce male hormones. Male genitals develop in response to male hormones from the fetal testicles.
In a fetus without a Y chromosome — without the effects of male hormones — the genitals develop as female.
A lack or deficiency of male hormones in a genetic male fetus can cause ambiguous genitalia, while exposure to male hormones during development results in ambiguous genitalia in a genetic female.
Mutations in certain genes can influence fetal sex development and cause ambiguous genitalia.
Chromosomal abnormalities, such as a missing sex chromosome or an extra one, also can cause ambiguous genitalia.
In some cases, the cause of ambiguous genitalia may not be determined.
 Certain forms of this genetic condition cause the adrenal glands to make excess male hormones (androgens).
 Certain drugs that contain male hormones or that stimulate production of male hormones in a pregnant woman can cause developing female genitals to become more masculine. A developing baby also may be exposed to excess male hormones if the mother has a disease or condition that causes hormone imbalance.
 Rarely, a tumor in the mother can produce male hormones.
 This may be due to genetic abnormalities or unknown causes.
 In this condition, developing genital tissues don't respond normally to male hormones made by the testes.
 Various abnormalities can interfere with the testes' activity. This may include structural problems with the testes, problems with production of the male hormone testosterone or problems with cellular receptors that respond to testosterone.
 This enzyme defect impairs normal male hormone production.
Unexplained deaths in early infancy
Infertility, absent menstrual periods or excess facial hair in females
Genital abnormalities
Abnormal physical development during puberty
Congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a group of inherited genetic disorders that affect the adrenal glands
 Whether people with ambiguous genitalia can have children depends on the specific diagnosis. For example, genetic females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia usually can get pregnant if they so choose.
 Some disorders of sex development are associated with an increased risk of certain types of cancer.
"
Hair loss," This is the most common type of hair loss, affecting people as they age. In men, hair often begins to recede at the hairline on the forehead. Women typically have a broadening of the part in their hair. An increasingly common hair loss pattern in older women is a receding hairline (frontal fibrosing alopecia).
 Some people lose hair in circular or patchy bald spots on the scalp, beard or eyebrows. Your skin may become itchy or painful before the hair falls out.
 A physical or emotional shock can cause hair to loosen. Handfuls of hair may come out when combing or washing your hair or even after gentle tugging. This type of hair loss usually causes overall hair thinning but is temporary.
 Some conditions and medical treatments, such as chemotherapy for cancer, can result in the loss of hair all over your body. The hair usually grows back.
 This is a sign of ringworm. It may be accompanied by broken hair, redness, swelling and, at times, oozing.
 The most common cause of hair loss is a hereditary condition that happens with aging. This condition is called androgenic alopecia, male-pattern baldness and female-pattern baldness. It usually occurs gradually and in predictable patterns — a receding hairline and bald spots in men and thinning hair along the crown of the scalp in women.
 A variety of conditions can cause permanent or temporary hair loss, including hormonal changes due to pregnancy, childbirth, menopause and thyroid problems. Medical conditions include alopecia areata (al-o-PEE-she-uh ar-e-A-tuh), which is immune system related and causes patchy hair loss, scalp infections such as ringworm, and a hair-pulling disorder called trichotillomania (trik-o-til-o-MAY-nee-uh).
 Hair loss can be a side effect of certain drugs, such as those used for cancer, arthritis, depression, heart problems, gout and high blood pressure.
 The hair may not grow back the same as it was before.
 Many people experience a general thinning of hair several months after a physical or emotional shock. This type of hair loss is temporary.
 Excessive hairstyling or hairstyles that pull your hair tight, such as pigtails or cornrows, can cause a type of hair loss called traction alopecia. Hot-oil hair treatments and permanents also can cause hair to fall out. If scarring occurs, hair loss could be permanent.

Be gentle with your hair. Use a detangler and avoid tugging when brushing and combing, especially when your hair is wet. A wide-toothed comb might help prevent pulling out hair. Avoid harsh treatments such as hot rollers, curling irons, hot-oil treatments and permanents. Limit the tension on hair from styles that use rubber bands, barrettes and braids.
Ask your doctor about medications and supplements you take that might cause hair loss.
Protect your hair from sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet light.
Stop smoking. Some studies show an association between smoking and baldness in men.
If you're being treated with chemotherapy, ask your doctor about a cooling cap. This cap can reduce your risk of losing hair during chemotherapy.

 Beta-amyloid is a fragment of a larger protein. When these fragments clump together, they appear to have a toxic effect on neurons and to disrupt communication between brain cells. These clumps form larger deposits called amyloid plaques, which also include other cellular debris.
 Tau proteins play a part in a brain cell's internal support and transport system to carry nutrients and other essential materials. In Alzheimer's disease, tau proteins change shape and organize into structures called neurofibrillary tangles. The tangles disrupt the transport system and cause damage to cells.

Dry socket,"Severe pain within a few days after removing a tooth.
Loss of part or all of the blood clot at the tooth removal site. The socket may look empty.
Bone that you can see in the socket.
Pain that spreads from the socket to your ear, eye, temple or neck on the same side of your face as the tooth removal.
Bad breath or a foul odor coming from your mouth.
Bad taste in your mouth.
Bacteria that gets into the socket.
Injury at the surgical site when tooth removal is difficult. This can happen with irregular wisdom tooth development or position, called an impacted wisdom tooth.
 Chemicals in cigarettes or other forms of tobacco may prevent or slow healing. These chemicals can get into the wound site. Also, the act of sucking on a cigarette may cause the blood clot to come out too early.
 High estrogen levels from birth control pills may cause problems with healing and increase the risk of dry socket.
 Not following home-care instructions and having poor mouth care may increase the risk of dry socket.
 Current or previous infections around the area where the tooth was removed increase the risk of dry socket.
Look for a dentist or oral surgeon with experience in removing teeth.
Practice good oral care by brushing your teeth twice a day and flossing once a day. Good oral care before surgery keeps your teeth and gums clean and removes bacteria.
If you smoke or use other tobacco products, try to stop smoking before your tooth is removed. Smoking and using other tobacco products increase your risk of dry socket. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about a program to help you quit for good.
Talk to your dentist or oral surgeon about any prescription medicines, medicines you can buy off the shelf, herbs, or other supplements you're taking. Some may cause problems with blood clotting.
Dressing with medicine to put on the wound after surgery.
Antibacterial mouthwashes or gels immediately before and after surgery.
Antiseptic solutions to put on the wound.
Oral antibiotics, usually only if you have a weakened immune system.
 After your surgery, plan to rest for that day. Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about when you can return to your usual activities. Also follow instructions about how long to avoid vigorous exercise and sports that might cause the blood clot to come out of the socket.
 Put cold packs on the outside of your face on the first day after tooth removal. After the first day, warm packs may help. Cold and warm packs can help decrease pain and swelling. Follow instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon about putting cold or heat on your face. Take pain medicines as prescribed.
 Drink lots of water after the surgery. Avoid alcoholic, caffeinated, carbonated or hot beverages for as long as recommended. Do not drink with a straw for at least a week. The sucking action may cause the blood clot to come out of the socket.
 Eat only soft foods, such as yogurt or applesauce, for the first day. Be careful with hot and cold liquids or biting your cheek until the numbness wears off. When you feel ready, start eating foods that do not need a lot of chewing. Avoid chewing on the surgery side of your mouth.
 After surgery, you may gently rinse your mouth and brush your teeth, but avoid the site where the tooth was removed for the first 24 hours. After the first 24 hours, gently rinse your mouth with warm salt water several times a day for a week after your surgery. Mix 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 milliliters) of table salt in 8 ounces (237 milliliters) of water. Follow the instructions from your dentist or oral surgeon.
 If you smoke or use tobacco, do not do so for at least 48 hours after surgery and as long as you can after that. Using tobacco products after oral surgery can slow healing and increase the risk of complications.

 The most common cause of peanut allergy is eating peanuts or peanut-containing foods. Sometimes direct skin contact with peanuts can trigger an allergic reaction.
 This is the unintended introduction of peanuts into a product. It's generally the result of a food being exposed to peanuts during processing or handling.
 An allergic reaction may occur if you inhale dust or aerosols containing peanuts, from a source such as peanut flour or peanut oil cooking spray.
 Food allergies are most common in children, especially toddlers and infants. As you grow older, your digestive system matures, and your body is less likely to react to food that triggers allergies.
 Some children with peanut allergy outgrow it. However, even if you seem to have outgrown peanut allergy, it may recur.
 If you're already allergic to one food, you may be at increased risk of becoming allergic to another. Likewise, having another type of allergy, such as hay fever, increases your risk of having a food allergy.
 You're at increased risk of peanut allergy if other allergies, especially other types of food allergies, are common in your family.
 Some people with the skin condition atopic dermatitis (eczema) also have a food allergy.

 The most common cause of latex allergy involves touching latex-containing products, including latex gloves, condoms and balloons.
 Latex products, especially gloves, release latex particles. You can breathe in these particles when they become airborne. The amount of airborne latex from gloves differs greatly depending on the brand of glove used.
 This reaction results from the chemical additives used during manufacturing. The main symptom is a skin rash with formation of blisters 24 to 48 hours after exposure, similar to poison ivy.
 Not an allergy, this skin irritation is caused by wearing rubber gloves or exposure to the powder inside them. Symptoms include dry, itchy, irritated areas, usually on the hands.
 The risk of latex allergy is highest in people with spina bifida — a birth defect that affects the development of the spine. People with this disorder often are exposed to latex products through early and frequent health care. People with spina bifida should always avoid latex products.
 Repeated exposure to latex gloves and medical products increases your risk of developing latex allergy.
 If you work in health care, you're at increased risk of developing a latex allergy.
 Repeated exposure to latex may increase sensitivity.
 You're at increased risk of latex allergy if you have other allergies — such as hay fever or a food allergy — or they're common in your family.

Living or working in an environment that constantly exposes you to allergens — such as animal dander or dust mites
Being exposed to smoke and strong odors that irritate the lining of the nose
Having a mother who smoked during your first year of life
 Hay fever can interfere with your enjoyment of activities and cause you to be less productive. For many people, hay fever symptoms lead to missing work or school.
 Hay fever symptoms can keep you awake or make it hard to stay asleep. This can lead to fatigue and a general feeling of being unwell (malaise).
 Hay fever can worsen symptoms of asthma, such as coughing and wheezing.
 Prolonged sinus congestion due to hay fever may increase your risk of getting sinusitis — an infection or inflammation of the membrane that lines the sinuses.
 In children, hay fever often is a factor in middle ear infection (otitis media).

 You may not have adequate amounts of some enzymes needed to digest certain foods. Insufficient amounts of the enzyme lactase, for example, reduce your ability to digest lactose, the main sugar in milk products. Lactose intolerance can cause bloating, cramping, diarrhea and excess gas.
 Sometimes food poisoning can mimic an allergic reaction. Bacteria in spoiled tuna and other fish also can make a toxin that triggers harmful reactions.
 Some people have digestive reactions and other symptoms after eating certain food additives. For example, sulfites used to preserve dried fruit, canned goods and wine can trigger asthma attacks in people with sensitivity to food additives.
 Certain fish, such as tuna or mackerel, that are not refrigerated properly and that contain high amounts of bacteria also may contain high levels of histamine that trigger symptoms similar to those of food allergy. Rather than an allergic reaction, this is known as histamine toxicity or scombroid poisoning.

    

    

    

    
 You're at increased risk of food allergies if asthma, eczema, hives or allergies such as hay fever are common in your family.
 If you're already allergic to one food, you may be at increased risk of becoming allergic to another. Similarly, if you have other types of allergic reactions, such as hay fever or eczema, your risk of having a food allergy is greater.

Having a history of asthma.
Being a teenager or younger.
Delaying use of epinephrine to treat your food allergy symptoms.
Not having hives or other skin symptoms.
 This is a life-threatening allergic reaction.
 Food allergy may cause a skin reaction, such as eczema.
 Be sure to read food labels carefully.
 wear a medical alert bracelet or necklace that lets others know that you have a food allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate.
 You may need to carry an epinephrine autoinjector (Adrenaclick, EpiPen) if you're at risk of a severe allergic reaction.

    

    

    
 If necessary, take a cooler packed with allergen-free foods when you travel or go to an event. If you or your child can't have the cake or dessert at a party, bring an approved special treat so no one feels left out of the celebration.
 Talk with child care providers, school personnel, parents of your child's friends and other adults who regularly interact with your child. Emphasize that an allergic reaction can be life-threatening and requires immediate action. Make sure that your child also knows to ask for help right away if your child reacts to food.
 Teach the adults who spend time with your child how to recognize signs and symptoms of an allergic reaction.
 Your plan should describe how to care for your child when your child has an allergic reaction to food. Provide a copy of the plan to your child's school nurse and others who care for and supervise your child.
 This alert lists your child's allergy symptoms and explains how others can provide first aid in an emergency.

 or another allergic condition
 If you have severe allergies, you're at increased risk of this serious allergy-induced reaction. Foods, medications and insect stings are the most common triggers of anaphylaxis.
 If you have an allergy, you're more likely to have asthma — an immune system reaction that affects the airways and breathing. In many cases, asthma is triggered by exposure to an allergen in the environment (allergy-induced asthma).
 Your risk of getting these conditions is higher if you have hay fever or asthma.
 Even if you're treating your allergy symptoms, try to avoid triggers. If, for instance, you're allergic to pollen, stay inside with windows and doors closed when pollen is high. If you're allergic to dust mites, dust and vacuum and wash bedding often.
 When trying to identify what causes or worsens your allergic symptoms, track your activities and what you eat, when symptoms occur and what seems to help. This may help you and your provider identify triggers.
 If you've had a severe allergic reaction, a medical alert bracelet (or necklace) lets others know that you have a serious allergy in case you have a reaction and you're unable to communicate.

Alcoholic hepatitis,"Loss of appetite.
Nausea and vomiting.
Belly tenderness.
Fever, often low grade.
Tiredness and weakness.
Fluid buildup in the belly, called ascites.
Being confused and acting oddly due to a buildup of toxins. The healthy liver breaks these toxins down and gets rid of them.
Kidney and liver failure.
Have symptoms of alcoholic hepatitis.
Can't control your drinking.
Want help cutting back on your drinking.
The body's way of breaking down alcohol makes highly toxic chemicals.
These chemicals trigger swelling, called inflammation, that destroys liver cells.
Over time, scars replace healthy liver tissue. This keeps the liver from working well.
This scarring, called cirrhosis, can't be fixed. It's the final stage of alcoholic liver disease.
 Alcoholic hepatitis can make chronic liver diseases worse. For instance, if you have hepatitis C and drink, even a little, you're more likely to get liver scarring than if you don't drink.
 Many people who drink heavily don't get enough nutrients because they eat poorly. And alcohol keeps the body from using nutrients as it should. Lack of nutrients can damage liver cells.
 Women seem to have a higher risk of getting alcoholic hepatitis. That might be because of how alcohol breaks down in women's bodies.
 Heavy drinkers who are overweight might be more likely to get alcoholic hepatitis. And they might be more likely to go on to get liver scarring.
 Studies suggest that genes might be involved in alcohol-induced liver disease.
 Black and Hispanic people might be at higher risk of alcoholic hepatitis.
 Having five or more drinks in about two hours for men and four or more for women might increase the risk of alcoholic hepatitis.

    

    

    
 Fluid that builds up in the belly might get infected and need treatment with antibiotics. Ascites isn't life-threatening. But it most often means advanced alcoholic hepatitis or cirrhosis.
 A damaged liver has trouble removing toxins from the body. The buildup of toxins can damage the brain. Severe hepatic encephalopathy can cause a coma.
 A damaged liver can affect blood flow to the kidneys. This can damage the kidneys.
 This scarring of the liver can lead to liver failure.
 For healthy adults, moderate drinking means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men. The only certain way to prevent alcoholic hepatitis is to avoid all alcohol.
 Hepatitis C is a liver disease caused by a virus. Without treatment, it can lead to cirrhosis. If you have hepatitis C and drink alcohol, you're far more likely to get cirrhosis than if you don't drink.

 Most people begin smoking during childhood or the teen years. The younger you are when you begin smoking, the greater the chance that you'll become addicted.
 The likelihood that you will start smoking and keep smoking may be partly inherited. Genetic factors may influence how receptors on the surface of your brain's nerve cells respond to high doses of nicotine delivered by cigarettes.
 Children who grow up with parents who smoke are more likely to become smokers. Children with friends who smoke are also more likely to try it.
 Many studies show an association between depression and smoking. People who have depression, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder or other forms of mental illness are more likely to be smokers.
 People who abuse alcohol and illegal drugs are more likely to be smokers.
 Smoking is the leading cause of lung cancer deaths. In addition, smoking causes lung diseases, such as emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also makes asthma worse.
 Smoking increases the risk of many types of cancer, including cancer of the mouth, throat (pharynx), esophagus, larynx, bladder, pancreas, kidney, cervix and some types of leukemia. Overall, smoking causes 30% of all cancer deaths.
 Smoking increases your risk of dying of heart and blood vessel (cardiovascular) disease, including heart attacks and strokes. If you have heart or blood vessel disease, such as heart failure, smoking worsens your condition.
 Smoking increases insulin resistance, which can set the stage for type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, smoking can speed the progress of complications, such as kidney disease and eye problems.
 Smoking can increase your risk of serious eye problems such as cataracts and loss of eyesight from macular degeneration.
 Smoking increases the risk of reduced fertility in women and the risk of impotence in men.
 Mothers who smoke while pregnant face a higher risk of preterm delivery and giving birth to lower birth weight babies.

ARDS,"Severe shortness of breath
Labored and unusually rapid breathing
Low blood pressure
Confusion and extreme tiredness
 The most common cause of 
 is sepsis, a serious and widespread infection of the bloodstream.
 Breathing high concentrations of smoke or chemical fumes can result in 
, as can inhaling (aspirating) vomit or near-drowning episodes.
 Severe cases of pneumonia usually affect all five lobes of the lungs.
 Accidents, such as falls or car crashes, can directly damage the lungs or the portion of the brain that controls breathing.
 People who have severe COVID-19 may develop 
.
 Pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), massive blood transfusions and burns.
 Lying still in the hospital while you're on a ventilator can increase your risk of developing blood clots, particularly in the deep veins in your legs. If a clot forms in your leg, a portion of it can break off and travel to one or both of your lungs (pulmonary embolism) — where it blocks blood flow.
 In most 
 cases, a breathing machine called a ventilator is used to increase oxygen in the body and force fluid out of the lungs. However, the pressure and air volume of the ventilator can force gas to go through a small hole in the very outside of a lung and cause that lung to collapse.
 Because the ventilator is attached directly to a tube inserted in your windpipe, this makes it much easier for germs to infect and further injure your lungs.
 Scarring and thickening of the tissue between the air sacs can occur within a few weeks of the onset of 
. This stiffens your lungs, making it even more difficult for oxygen to flow from the air sacs into your bloodstream.
 Many people with 
 recover most of their lung function within several months to two years, but others may have breathing problems for the rest of their lives. Even people who do well usually have shortness of breath and fatigue and may need supplemental oxygen at home for a few months.
 Most 
 survivors also report going through a period of depression, which is treatable.
 Sedatives and low levels of oxygen in the blood can lead to memory loss and cognitive problems after 
. In some cases, the effects may lessen over time, but in others, the damage may be permanent.
 Being in the hospital and on a ventilator can cause your muscles to weaken. You also may feel very tired following treatment.

 either from smoking or being around others who smoke, known as secondhand smoke.
 Acute sinusitis can be a flare-up of a long-term problem known as chronic sinusitis. Chronic sinusitis lasts longer than 12 weeks.
 This infection affects the membranes and fluid around the brain and spinal cord.
 It's not common. But an infection can spread to the bones, known as osteomyelitis, or to skin, known as cellulitis.
 If the infection spreads to the eye socket, it can reduce vision or cause blindness.
 Try to stay away from people who have colds or other infections. Wash your hands often with soap and water, such as before meals.
 Work with your health care provider to keep symptoms under control.
 Tobacco smoke and other pollutants can irritate lungs and inside the nose, known as nasal passages.
 If the air in your home is dry, adding moisture to the air may help prevent sinusitis. Be sure the humidifier stays clean and free of mold with regular, complete cleaning.

Alcohol use disorder,"Being unable to limit the amount of alcohol you drink
Wanting to cut down on how much you drink or making unsuccessful attempts to do so
Spending a lot of time drinking, getting alcohol or recovering from alcohol use
Feeling a strong craving or urge to drink alcohol
Failing to fulfill major obligations at work, school or home due to repeated alcohol use
Continuing to drink alcohol even though you know it's causing physical, social, work or relationship problems
Giving up or reducing social and work activities and hobbies to use alcohol
Using alcohol in situations where it's not safe, such as when driving or swimming
Developing a tolerance to alcohol so you need more to feel its effect or you have a reduced effect from the same amount
Experiencing withdrawal symptoms — such as nausea, sweating and shaking — when you don't drink, or drinking to avoid these symptoms
 results as the amount of alcohol in your bloodstream increases. The higher the blood alcohol concentration is, the more likely you are to have bad effects. Alcohol intoxication causes behavior problems and mental changes. These may include inappropriate behavior, unstable moods, poor judgment, slurred speech, problems with attention or memory, and poor coordination. You can also have periods called ""blackouts,"" where you don't remember events. Very high blood alcohol levels can lead to coma, permanent brain damage or even death.
 can occur when alcohol use has been heavy and prolonged and is then stopped or greatly reduced. It can occur within several hours to 4 to 5 days later. Signs and symptoms include sweating, rapid heartbeat, hand tremors, problems sleeping, nausea and vomiting, hallucinations, restlessness and agitation, anxiety, and occasionally seizures. Symptoms can be severe enough to impair your ability to function at work or in social situations.
12 ounces (355 milliliters) of regular beer (about 5% alcohol)
8 to 9 ounces (237 to 266 milliliters) of malt liquor (about 7% alcohol)
5 ounces (148 milliliters) of wine (about 12% alcohol)
1.5 ounces (44 milliliters) of hard liquor or distilled spirits (about 40% alcohol)
 Drinking too much on a regular basis for an extended period or binge drinking on a regular basis can lead to alcohol-related problems or alcohol use disorder.
 People who begin drinking — especially binge drinking — at an early age are at a higher risk of alcohol use disorder.
 The risk of alcohol use disorder is higher for people who have a parent or other close relative who has problems with alcohol. This may be influenced by genetic factors.
 It's common for people with a mental health disorder such as anxiety, depression, schizophrenia or bipolar disorder to have problems with alcohol or other substances.
 People with a history of emotional trauma or other trauma are at increased risk of alcohol use disorder.
 Some research studies indicate that having bariatric surgery may increase the risk of developing alcohol use disorder or of relapsing after recovering from alcohol use disorder.
 Having friends or a close partner who drinks regularly could increase your risk of alcohol use disorder. The glamorous way that drinking is sometimes portrayed in the media also may send the message that it's OK to drink too much. For young people, the influence of parents, peers and other role models can impact risk.
Motor vehicle accidents and other types of accidental injury, such as drowning
Relationship problems
Poor performance at work or school
Increased likelihood of committing violent crimes or being the victim of a crime
Legal problems or problems with employment or finances
Problems with other substance use
Engaging in risky, unprotected sex, or experiencing sexual abuse or date rape
Increased risk of attempted or completed suicide
 Heavy drinking can cause increased fat in the liver (hepatic steatosis) and inflammation of the liver (alcoholic hepatitis). Over time, heavy drinking can cause irreversible destruction and scarring of liver tissue (cirrhosis).
 Heavy drinking can result in inflammation of the stomach lining (gastritis), as well as stomach and esophageal ulcers. It can also interfere with your body's ability to get enough B vitamins and other nutrients. Heavy drinking can damage your pancreas or lead to inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis).
 Excessive drinking can lead to high blood pressure and increases your risk of an enlarged heart, heart failure or stroke. Even a single binge can cause serious irregular heartbeats (arrhythmia) called atrial fibrillation.
 Alcohol interferes with the release of glucose from your liver and can increase the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia). This is dangerous if you have diabetes and are already taking insulin or some other diabetes medications to lower your blood sugar level.
 Heavy drinking can cause men to have difficulty maintaining an erection (erectile dysfunction). In women, heavy drinking can interrupt menstrual periods.
 Over time, heavy drinking can cause involuntary rapid eye movement (nystagmus) as well as weakness and paralysis of your eye muscles due to a deficiency of vitamin B-1 (thiamin). A thiamin deficiency can result in other brain changes, such as irreversible dementia, if not promptly treated.
 Alcohol use during pregnancy may cause miscarriage. It may also cause fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). 
 can cause a child to be born with physical and developmental problems that last a lifetime.
 Alcohol may interfere with making new bone. Bone loss can lead to thinning bones (osteoporosis) and an increased risk of fractures. Alcohol can also damage bone marrow, which makes blood cells. This can cause a low platelet count, which may result in bruising and bleeding.
 Excessive drinking can affect your nervous system, causing numbness and pain in your hands and feet, disordered thinking, dementia, and short-term memory loss.
 Excessive alcohol use can make it harder for your body to resist disease, increasing your risk of various illnesses, especially pneumonia.
 Long-term, excessive alcohol use has been linked to a higher risk of many cancers, including mouth, throat, liver, esophagus, colon and breast cancers. Even moderate drinking can increase the risk of breast cancer.
 Some medications interact with alcohol, increasing its toxic effects. Drinking while taking these medications can either increase or decrease their effectiveness, or make them dangerous.
Loss of interest in activities and hobbies and in personal appearance
Red eyes, slurred speech, problems with coordination and memory lapses
Difficulties or changes in relationships with friends, such as joining a new crowd
Declining grades and problems in school
Frequent mood changes and defensive behavior
Set a good example with your own alcohol use.
Talk openly with your child, spend quality time together and become actively involved in your child's life.
Let your child know what behavior you expect — and what the consequences will be for not following the rules.

Acute liver failure,"Yellowing of your skin and eyeballs (jaundice)
Pain in your upper right abdomen
A swollen belly (ascites)
Nausea
Vomiting
A general sense of feeling unwell (malaise)
Disorientation or confusion
Sleepiness
Breath may have a musty or sweet odor
Tremors

    
 Some prescription medications, including antibiotics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and anticonvulsants, can cause acute liver failure.
 Herbal drugs and supplements, including kava, ephedra, skullcap and pennyroyal, have been linked to acute liver failure.
 Hepatitis A, hepatitis B and hepatitis E can cause acute liver failure. Other viruses that can cause acute liver failure include Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus and herpes simplex virus.
 Toxins that can cause acute liver failure include the poisonous wild mushroom Amanita phalloides, which is sometimes mistaken for one that is safe to eat. Carbon tetrachloride is another toxin that can cause acute liver failure. It is an industrial chemical found in refrigerants and solvents for waxes, varnishes and other materials.
 Liver failure can be caused by autoimmune hepatitis — a disease in which your immune system attacks liver cells, causing inflammation and injury.
 Vascular diseases, such as Budd-Chiari syndrome, can cause blockages in the veins of the liver and lead to acute liver failure.
 Rare metabolic diseases, such as Wilson's disease and acute fatty liver of pregnancy, infrequently cause acute liver failure.
 Cancer that either begins in or spreads to your liver can cause your liver to fail.
 Overwhelming infection (sepsis) and shock can severely reduce blood flow to the liver, causing liver failure.
 Extreme physical activity in a hot environment can trigger acute liver failure.
 Too much fluid causes pressure to build up in your brain, which can lead to disorientation, severe mental confusion and seizures.
 A failing liver cannot make enough clotting factors, which help blood to clot. Bleeding in the gastrointestinal tract is common with this condition. It may be difficult to control.
 People with acute liver failure are more likely to develop infections, particularly in the blood and in the respiratory and urinary tracts.
 Kidney failure often occurs after liver failure, especially if you had an acetaminophen overdose, which damages both your liver and your kidneys.
 If you take acetaminophen or other medications, check the package insert for the recommended dosage, and don't take more than that. If you already have liver disease, ask your health care provider if it is safe to take any amount of acetaminophen.
 Even over-the-counter and herbal medicines can interfere with prescription drugs you're taking.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to one drink a day for women and up to two drinks a day for men.
 Get help if you use illicit intravenous drugs. Don't share needles. Use condoms during sex. If you get tattoos or body piercings, make sure the shop you choose is clean and safe. Don't smoke.
 If you have chronic liver disease, a history of any type of hepatitis infection or an increased risk of hepatitis, talk to your provider about getting the hepatitis B vaccine. A vaccine also is available for hepatitis A.
 Accidental needle sticks or improper cleanup of blood or body fluids can spread hepatitis viruses. Sharing razor blades or toothbrushes also can spread infection.
 It can be difficult to tell the difference between a poisonous mushroom and one that is safe to eat.
 When you use an aerosol cleaner, make sure the room is ventilated, or wear a mask. Take similar protective measures when spraying insecticides, fungicides, paint and other toxic chemicals. Follow product instructions carefully.
 When using insecticides and other toxic chemicals, cover your skin with gloves, long sleeves, a hat and a mask.
 Obesity can cause a condition called nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, which may include fatty liver, hepatitis and cirrhosis.

 The weakness or paralysis can spread to the muscles that control your breathing, a potentially fatal complication. Up to 22% of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome need temporary help from a machine to breathe within the first week when they're hospitalized for treatment.
 Most people with Guillain-Barre syndrome recover completely or have only minor, residual weakness, numbness or tingling.
 Blood pressure fluctuations and irregular heart rhythms (cardiac arrhythmias) are common side effects of Guillain-Barre syndrome.
 One-third of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome experience severe nerve pain, which may be eased with medication.
 Sluggish bowel function and urine retention may result from Guillain-Barre syndrome.
 People who are immobile due to Guillain-Barre syndrome are at risk of developing blood clots. Until you're able to walk independently, taking blood thinners and wearing support stockings may be recommended.
 Being immobile also puts you at risk of developing bedsores (pressure sores). Frequent repositioning may help avoid this problem.
 A small percentage of people with Guillain-Barre syndrome have a relapse, experiencing muscle weakness even years after the symptoms ended.

 Most acromegaly cases are caused by a noncancerous (benign) tumor (adenoma) of the pituitary gland. The tumor produces excessive amounts of growth hormone, causing many of the signs and symptoms of acromegaly. Some of the symptoms of acromegaly, such as headaches and impaired vision, are due to the tumor pressing on nearby brain tissues.
 In a few people with acromegaly, tumors in other parts of the body, such as the lungs or pancreas, cause the disorder. Sometimes, these tumors secrete

Certain cancers and their treatments
 Acute kidney failure may lead to a buildup of fluid in your lungs, which can cause shortness of breath.
 If the lining that covers your heart (pericardium) becomes inflamed, you may experience chest pain.
 When your body's fluids and electrolytes — your body's blood chemistry — are out of balance, muscle weakness can result.
 Occasionally, acute kidney failure causes permanent loss of kidney function, or end-stage renal disease. People with end-stage renal disease require either permanent dialysis — a mechanical filtration process used to remove toxins and wastes from the body — or a kidney transplant to survive.
 Acute kidney failure can lead to loss of kidney function and, ultimately, death.
 Follow the instructions for 
 pain medications, such as aspirin, acetaminophen (Tylenol, others), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others). Taking too much of these medications may increase your risk of kidney injury. This is especially true if you have pre-existing kidney disease, diabetes or high blood pressure.
 If you have kidney disease or another condition that increases your risk of acute kidney failure, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, stay on track with treatment goals and follow your doctor's recommendations to manage your condition.
 Be active; eat a sensible, balanced diet; and drink alcohol only in moderation — if at all.

 You may become infected if you have vaginal, anal or oral sex with an infected partner whose blood, semen or vaginal secretions enter your body. The virus can enter your body through mouth sores or small tears that sometimes develop in the rectum or vagina during sexual activity.
 Sharing contaminated injection drug paraphernalia (needles and syringes) puts you at high risk of 
 and other infectious diseases, such as hepatitis.
 In some cases, the virus may be transmitted through blood transfusions. Hospitals and blood banks screen the blood supply for 
, so this risk is very small in the U.S. and other upper-middle-income countries. The risk may be higher in low-income countries that are not able to screen all donated blood.
 Infected mothers can pass the virus on to their babies. Mothers who are 
-positive and get treatment for the infection during pregnancy can significantly lower the risk to their babies.
 Use a new latex or polyurethane condom every time you have sex. Anal sex is riskier than is vaginal sex. Your risk of 
 increases if you have multiple sexual partners.
 Many 
 produce open sores on your genitals. These sores act as doorways for 
 to enter your body.
 People who use illicit injection drugs often share needles and syringes. This exposes them to droplets of other people's blood.
 This fungal infection can cause severe illness. Although it's declined significantly with current treatments for

. It's less common in the U.S. thanks to the wide use of 
 medications.
 This common herpes virus is transmitted in body fluids such as saliva, blood, urine, semen and breast milk. A healthy immune system inactivates the virus, and it remains dormant in your body. If your immune system weakens, the virus resurfaces — causing damage to your eyes, digestive tract, lungs or other organs.
 Meningitis is an inflammation of the membranes and fluid surrounding your brain and spinal cord (meninges). Cryptococcal meningitis is a common central nervous system infection associated with 
, caused by a fungus found in soil.
 This potentially deadly infection is caused by Toxoplasma gondii, a parasite spread primarily by cats. Infected cats pass the parasites in their stools, which may then spread to other animals and humans. Toxoplasmosis can cause heart disease, and seizures occur when it spreads to the brain.
 This cancer starts in the white blood cells. The most common early sign is painless swelling of the lymph nodes in your neck, armpit or groin.
 A tumor of the blood vessel walls, Kaposi's sarcoma usually appears as pink, red or purple lesions on the skin and mouth. In people with darker skin, the lesions may look dark brown or black. Kaposi's sarcoma can also affect the internal organs, including the digestive tract and lungs.
 These are cancers caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection. They include anal, oral and cervical cancer.

-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) is an inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys that remove excess fluid and wastes from your blood and pass them to your urine. It most often affects Black or Hispanic people.
 Liver disease is also a major complication, especially in people who also have hepatitis B or hepatitis C.

    

    

    

    

    
 If you're living with 
, taking 
 medication can keep your partner from becoming infected with the virus. If you make sure your viral load stays undetectable — a blood test doesn't show any virus — you won't transmit the virus to anyone else through sex. Using 
 means taking your medication exactly as prescribed and getting regular checkups.
 If you think you've been exposed through sex, needles or in the workplace, contact your health care provider or go to the emergency department. Taking 
 as soon as possible within the first 72 hours can greatly reduce your risk of becoming infected with 
. You will need to take medication for 28 days.
 Use a new condom every time you have anal or vaginal sex. Women can use a female condom. If using a lubricant, make sure it's water-based. Oil-based lubricants can weaken condoms and cause them to break. During oral sex use a nonlubricated, cut-open condom or a dental dam — a piece of medical-grade latex.
 It's important to tell all your current and past sexual partners that you're 
-positive. They'll need to be tested.
 If you use a needle to inject illicit drugs, make sure it's sterile and don't share it. Take advantage of needle-exchange programs in your community. Consider seeking help for your drug use.
 If you're 
-positive, you may pass the infection to your baby. But if you receive treatment during pregnancy, you can significantly cut your baby's risk.
 There's evidence that male circumcision can help reduce the risk of getting 
 infection.

 Androgens are hormones that increase in boys and girls during puberty and cause the sebaceous glands to enlarge and make more sebum. Hormone changes during midlife, particularly in women, can lead to breakouts too.
 Examples include drugs containing corticosteroids, testosterone or lithium.
 Studies indicate that consuming certain foods — including carbohydrate-rich foods, such as bread, bagels and chips — may worsen acne. Further study is needed to examine whether people with acne would benefit from following specific dietary restrictions.
 Stress doesn't cause acne, but if you have acne already, stress may make it worse.
 Eating chocolate or greasy food has little to no effect on acne.
 Acne isn't caused by dirty skin. In fact, scrubbing the skin too hard or cleansing with harsh soaps or chemicals irritates the skin and can make acne worse.
 Cosmetics don't necessarily worsen acne, especially if you use oil-free makeup that doesn't clog pores (noncomedogenics) and remove makeup regularly. Nonoily cosmetics don't interfere with the effectiveness of acne drugs.
 Pitted skin (acne scars) and thick scars (keloids) can remain long-term after acne has healed.
 After acne has cleared, the affected skin may be darker (hyperpigmented) or lighter (hypopigmented) than before the condition occurred.
 People of all ages can get acne, but it's most common in teenagers.
 Such changes are common during puberty or pregnancy.
 Genetics plays a role in acne. If both of your parents had acne, you're likely to develop it too.
 You may develop acne where your skin comes into contact with oil or oily lotions and creams.
 This can be caused by items such as telephones, cellphones, helmets, tight collars and backpacks.

Hidradenitis suppurativa," Blackheads appear in small, pitted areas of skin, often appearing in pairs.
 The condition usually starts with a single, painful lump under the skin that persists for weeks or months. More bumps may form later, usually in areas where you have more sweat and oil glands or where the skin rubs together, such as the armpits, groin, buttocks and breasts.
 Some bumps or sores get bigger, break open and drain pus with an odor.
 Over time, tunnels might form under the skin, connecting the lumps. These wounds heal slowly, if at all, and drain blood and pus.
Is painful.
Makes it difficult to move.
Doesn't improve in a few weeks.
Returns within weeks of treatment.
Appears in several locations.
Flares often.
 The risk of hidradenitis suppurativa is higher for people in their teens and 20s.
 Females are more likely to develop hidradenitis suppurativa than males.
 Ethnicity or race might affect risk level. The condition occurs most in Black people, possibly due to genetic factors.
 A tendency to develop hidradenitis suppurativa can be inherited.
 Hidradenitis suppurativa is more common and severe in people who are overweight. It also has an association with severe acne, arthritis, diabetes, metabolic syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease.
 Smoking tobacco has been linked to hidradenitis suppurativa.
 Secondary infection is possible in the affected area, but the presence of pus is common in hidradenitis suppurativa and doesn't necessarily mean infection.
 The wounds may heal but leave ropelike scars or pitted skin.
 Sores and scar tissue can cause limited or painful movement, especially when the disease affects the armpits or thighs.
 Squamous cell carcinoma has been reported with long-term hidradenitis suppurativa, particularly in people whose condition involves the perianal area. This area consists of the tissues around the anus.
 The most common sites for hidradenitis suppurativa also contain many lymph nodes. Scar tissue can interfere with the lymph drainage system, which can cause the arms, legs or genitals to swell.
 The location, drainage and odor of the sores can cause embarrassment and reluctance to go out in public, leading to anxiety or depression.
 This pain is much worse than diseases such as psoriasis.

Infant reflux,"Isn't gaining weight.
Consistently spits up forcefully, causing stomach contents to shoot out of the mouth. This is called projectile vomiting.
Spits up green or yellow fluid.
Spits up blood or stomach contents that look like coffee grounds.
Refuses to feed or eat.
Has blood in the stool.
Has difficulty breathing or a cough that won't go away.
Begins spitting up at age 6 months or older.
Is unusually irritable after eating.
Doesn't have much energy.
 The reflux has enough acid to irritate and damage the lining of the esophagus.
 A muscular valve allows food to leave the stomach and enter the small intestine as part of digestion. In pyloric stenosis, the valve thickens and becomes larger than it should. The thickened valve then traps food in the stomach and blocks it from entering the small intestine.
 A protein in cow's milk is the most common trigger.
 A certain type of white blood cell builds up and injures the lining of the esophagus. This white blood cell is called an eosinophil.
 This causes irregular tilting and rotation of the head, and movements that resemble seizures. It's a rarely seen consequence of 
.
Premature birth
Lung conditions, such as cystic fibrosis
Conditions that affect the nervous system, such as cerebral palsy
Previous surgery on the esophagus
"
Absence seizure,"A sudden stop in activity without falling.
Lip smacking.
Eyelid flutters.
Chewing motions.
Finger rubbing.
Small movements of both hands.
If you're concerned that your child may be having seizures.
If your child has epilepsy but develops symptoms of a new type of seizure.
If the seizures continue to occur despite taking anti-seizure medicine.
If you observe prolonged automatic behaviors lasting minutes to hours. This may include activities such as eating or moving without awareness. It also might include prolonged confusion. These are possible symptoms of a condition called status epilepticus.
After any seizure lasting more than five minutes.
 Absence seizures are more common in children between the ages of 4 and 14.
 Absence seizures are more common in females.
 Nearly a quarter of children with absence seizures have a close relative who has seizures.
Must take anti-seizure medicines throughout life.
Eventually have full convulsions, such as generalized tonic-clonic seizures.

Achilles tendon rupture,"The feeling of having been kicked in the calf
Pain, possibly severe, and swelling near the heel
An inability to bend the foot downward or ""push off"" the injured leg when walking
An inability to stand on the toes on the injured leg
A popping or snapping sound when the injury occurs
Increasing the intensity of sports participation, especially in sports that involve jumping
Falling from a height
Stepping into a hole
 The peak age for Achilles tendon rupture is 30 to 40.
 Achilles tendon rupture is up to five times more likely to occur in men than in women.
 Achilles tendon injuries occur more often during sports that involve running, jumping, and sudden starts and stops — such as soccer, basketball and tennis.
 Doctors sometimes inject steroids into an ankle joint to reduce pain and inflammation. However, this medication can weaken nearby tendons and has been associated with Achilles tendon ruptures.
 Fluoroquinolone antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin (Cipro) or levofloxacin (Levaquin), increase the risk of Achilles tendon rupture.
 Excess weight puts more strain on the tendon.
 Stretch your calf until you feel a noticeable pull but not pain. Don't bounce during a stretch. Calf-strengthening exercises can also help the muscle and tendon absorb more force and prevent injury.
 Alternate high-impact sports, such as running, with low-impact sports, such as walking, biking or swimming. Avoid activities that place excessive stress on your Achilles tendons, such as hill running and jumping activities.
 Avoid or limit running on hard or slippery surfaces. Dress properly for cold-weather training, and wear well-fitting athletic shoes with proper cushioning in the heels.
 Achilles tendon injuries commonly occur after an abrupt increase in training intensity. Increase the distance, duration and frequency of your training by no more than 10 percent weekly.

Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD),"A burning sensation in your chest (heartburn), usually after eating, which might be worse at night or while lying down
Backwash (regurgitation) of food or sour liquid
Upper abdominal or chest pain
Trouble swallowing (dysphagia)
Sensation of a lump in your throat
An ongoing cough
Inflammation of the vocal cords (laryngitis)
New or worsening asthma
Experience severe or frequent 
 symptoms
Take over-the-counter medications for heartburn more than twice a week
Obesity
Bulging of the top of the stomach up above the diaphragm (hiatal hernia)
Pregnancy
Connective tissue disorders, such as scleroderma
Delayed stomach emptying
Smoking
Eating large meals or eating late at night
Eating certain foods (triggers) such as fatty or fried foods
Drinking certain beverages, such as alcohol or coffee
Taking certain medications, such as aspirin
 Stomach acid can break down tissue in the esophagus, causing inflammation, bleeding, and sometimes an open sore (ulcer). Esophagitis can cause pain and make swallowing difficult.
 Damage to the lower esophagus from stomach acid causes scar tissue to form. The scar tissue narrows the food pathway, leading to problems with swallowing.
 Damage from acid can cause changes in the tissue lining the lower esophagus. These changes are associated with an increased risk of esophageal cancer.

Difficulty in walking or bearing weight
 The crushing injuries common in car accidents may cause breaks that require surgical repair.
 Tripping and falling can break bones in your feet, as can landing on your feet after jumping down from just a slight height.
 Dropping something heavy on your foot is a common cause of fractures.
 Sometimes just putting your foot down wrong can result in a broken bone. A toe can get broken from stubbing your toes on furniture.
 Stress fractures are common in the weight-bearing bones of your feet. These tiny cracks are usually caused over time by repetitive force or overuse, such as running long distances. But they can also occur with normal use of a bone that's been weakened by a condition such as osteoporosis.
 The stresses, direct blows and twisting injuries that occur in sports such as basketball, football, gymnastics, tennis and soccer can causes foot fractures.
 Faulty equipment, such as shoes that are too worn or not properly fitted, can contribute to stress fractures and falls. Improper training techniques, such as not warming up and stretching, also can cause foot injuries.
 Whether you're a trained athlete or someone who's just started exercising, suddenly boosting the frequency or duration of your exercise sessions can increase your risk of a stress fracture.
 Certain work environments, such as a construction site, put you at risk of falling from a height or dropping something heavy on your foot.
 Walking around in a house with too much clutter or too little light may lead to falls and foot injuries.
 Having decreased bone density (osteoporosis) can put you at risk of injuries to your foot bones.
 Fractures that extend into a joint can cause arthritis years later. If your foot starts to hurt long after a break, see your doctor for an evaluation.
 If you have an open fracture, meaning one end of the bone protrudes through the skin, your bone may be exposed to bacteria that cause infection.
 Trauma to the foot can injure adjacent nerves and blood vessels, sometimes actually tearing them. Seek immediate attention if you notice any numbness or circulation problems. Lack of blood flow can cause a bone to die and collapse.
 Use hiking shoes on rough terrain. Wear steel-toed boots in your work environment if necessary. Choose appropriate athletic shoes for your sport.
 Discard sneakers as soon as the tread or heel wears out or if the shoes are wearing unevenly. If you're a runner, replace your sneakers every 300 to 400 miles.
 That applies to a new fitness program and each individual workout.
 Alternating activities can prevent stress fractures. Rotate running with swimming or biking.
 Calcium-rich foods, such as milk, yogurt and cheese, really can do your body good. Taking vitamin D supplements also can help.
 Many broken toes are the result of walking in the dark.
 Keeping clutter off the floor can help you to avoid trips and falls.

Abdominal aortic aneurysm,"Deep, constant pain in the belly area or side of the belly.
Back pain.
A pulse near the bellybutton.
 Atherosclerosis occurs when fat and other substances build up on the lining of a blood vessel.
 High blood pressure can damage and weaken the aorta's walls.
 These are diseases that cause blood vessels to become inflamed.
 Rarely, infection by certain bacteria or fungi might cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 For example, being injured in a car accident can cause an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Smoking is the strongest risk factor for aortic aneurysms. Smoking can weaken the walls of blood vessels, including the aorta. This raises the risk of aortic aneurysm and aneurysm rupture. The longer and more you use tobacco, the greater the chances are of developing an aortic aneurysm. Men ages 65 to 75 who are current or former smokers should have a one-time ultrasound to screen for an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
 Abdominal aortic aneurysms occur most often in people age 65 and older.
 Men develop abdominal aortic aneurysms much more often than women do.
 People who are white are at higher risk of abdominal aortic aneurysms.
 Having a family history of abdominal aortic aneurysms increases the risk of having the condition.
 Having an aneurysm in the aorta in the chest (thoracic aortic aneurysm) or in another large blood vessel, such as the artery behind the knee, might increase the risk of an abdominal aortic aneurysm.
Tears in one or more of the layers of the wall of the aorta, called an aortic dissection.
Rupture of the aneurysm.
Sudden, intense and persistent belly or back pain, which may feel like ripping or tearing.
Low blood pressure.
Fast pulse.
 If you smoke or chew tobacco, quit. Also avoid secondhand smoke. If you need help quitting, talk to your health care provider about strategies that may help.
 Choose a variety of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, chicken, fish, and low-fat dairy products. Avoid saturated and trans fats and limit salt.
 If your care provider prescribed medicines, take them as instructed.
 Try to get at least 150 minutes a week of moderate aerobic activity. If you haven't been active, start slowly and build up. Talk to your health care provider about what kinds of activities are right for you.

 People who are obese have a higher risk of kidney cancer than people who are considered to have a healthy weight.
 High blood pressure increases your risk of kidney cancer.
 People who receive long-term dialysis to treat chronic kidney failure have a greater risk of developing kidney cancer.
 People who are born with certain inherited syndromes may have an increased risk of kidney cancer, such as those who have von Hippel-Lindau disease, Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, tuberous sclerosis complex, hereditary papillary renal cell carcinoma or familial renal cancer.
 The risk of kidney cancer is higher if close family members have had the disease.
 If you smoke, quit. Many options for quitting exist, including support programs, medications and nicotine replacement products. Tell your doctor you want to quit, and discuss your options together.
 Work to maintain a healthy weight. If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you consume each day and try to be physically active most days of the week. Ask your doctor about other healthy strategies to help you lose weight.
 Ask your doctor to check your blood pressure at your next appointment. If your blood pressure is high, you can discuss options for lowering your numbers. Lifestyle measures such as exercise, weight loss and diet changes can help. Some people may need to add medications to lower their blood pressure. Discuss your options with your doctor.

 If you've been directly exposed to asbestos fibers at work or at home, your risk of mesothelioma is greatly increased.
 People who are exposed to asbestos may carry the fibers home on their skin and clothing. Exposure to these stray fibers over many years can put others in the home at risk of mesothelioma. People who work with high levels of asbestos can reduce the risk of bringing home asbestos fibers by showering and changing clothes before leaving work.
 If your parent, sibling or child has mesothelioma, you may have an increased risk of this disease.
 If you had radiation therapy for cancer in your chest, you might have an increased risk of mesothelioma.

Merkel cell carcinoma," Being exposed to ultraviolet light, such as the light that comes from the sun or from tanning beds, increases your risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. The majority of Merkel cell carcinomas appear on skin surfaces frequently exposed to sun.
 People with weakened immune systems — including those with HIV infection, those taking drugs that suppress the immune response or those with chronic leukemias — are more likely to develop Merkel cell carcinoma.
 Merkel cell carcinoma is associated with the development of other skin cancers, such as basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma.
 Your risk of Merkel cell carcinoma increases as you age. This cancer is most common in people older than age 50, though it can occur at any age.
 Merkel cell carcinoma usually arises in people who have light-colored skin. Whites are much more likely to be affected by this skin cancer than are blacks.
 Avoid sun exposure as much as possible during the strongest sunlight hours of the day — typically from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Move your outdoor activities to a time earlier in the morning or later in the day.
 Wear a wide-brimmed hat, tightly woven clothing and sunglasses with ultraviolet (UV) light protection.
 Use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of at least 30, even on cloudy days. Apply sunscreen generously, and reapply every two hours — or more often if you're swimming or perspiring.
 If you notice a mole, freckle or bump that's changing in size, shape or color, talk to your doctor. Most skin nodules never become cancer, but catching cancer in its early stages increases the chances that treatment will be successful.
