Atrial fibrillation,"Feelings of a fast, fluttering or pounding heartbeat, called palpitations.
Chest pain.
Dizziness.
Fatigue.
Lightheadedness.
Reduced ability to exercise.
Shortness of breath.
Weakness.
 
 symptoms come and go. The symptoms usually last for a few minutes to hours. Some people have symptoms for as long as a week. The episodes can happen repeatedly. Symptoms might go away on their own. Some people with occasional 
 need treatment.
 The irregular heartbeat is constant. The heart rhythm does not reset on its own. If symptoms occur, medical treatment is needed to correct the heart rhythm.
 This type of 
 is constant and lasts longer than 12 months. Medicines or a procedure are needed to correct the irregular heartbeat.
 In this type of atrial fibrillation, the irregular heart rhythm can't be reset. Medicines are needed to control the heart rate and to prevent blood clots.
The two upper chambers are called the atria.
The two lower chambers are called the ventricles.
A heart problem you're born with, called a congenital heart defect.
A problem with the heart's natural pacemaker, called sick sinus syndrome.
A sleep disorder called obstructive sleep apnea.
Heart attack.
Heart valve disease.
High blood pressure.
Lung diseases, including pneumonia.
Narrowed or blocked arteries, called coronary artery disease.
Thyroid disease such as an overactive thyroid.
Infections from viruses.
Drinking too much alcohol or caffeine.
Illegal drug use.
Smoking or using tobacco.
Taking medicines that contain stimulants, including cold and allergy medicines bought without a prescription.
 The risk of 
 increases as you grow older.
 Caffeine, nicotine and some illegal drugs â€” such as amphetamines and cocaine â€” can cause your heart to beat faster. Use of these substances may lead to the development of more-serious arrhythmias.
 Drinking too much alcohol can affect the electrical signals in the heart. This can increase the risk of atrial fibrillation.
 Minerals in the blood called electrolytes â€” such as potassium, sodium, calcium and magnesium â€” help the heart beat. If these substances are too low or too high, irregular heartbeats may occur.
 An increased risk of atrial fibrillation occurs in some families.
 Coronary artery disease, heart valve disease and heart problems present at birth increase the risk of 
. A history of heart attack or heart surgery also makes a person more likely to get the condition.
 Having high blood pressure increases the risk of getting coronary artery disease. Over time, high blood pressure may cause part of the heart to become stiff and thick. This can change how heartbeat signals travel through the heart.
 People who have obesity are at higher risk of developing atrial fibrillation.
 You may be more likely to get 
 if you have diabetes, chronic kidney disease, lung disease or sleep apnea.
 Some prescription medicines and certain cough and cold remedies bought without a prescription can cause irregular heartbeats.
 Having an overactive thyroid gland can raise the risk of irregular heartbeats.
High blood pressure.
Diabetes.
Heart failure.
Some types of heart valve disease.
Control high blood pressure, high cholesterol and diabetes.
Don't smoke or use tobacco.
Eat a diet that's low in salt and saturated fat.

Dry macular degeneration,"Visual distortions, such as straight lines seeming bent.
Reduced central vision in one or both eyes.
The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Increased difficulty adapting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
You notice changes, such as distortion or blind spots, in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
 This disease is most common in people over 60.
 This disease has a hereditary component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
 Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
 Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.
 Research indicates that being obese may increase your chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to the more severe form of the disease.
 If you have heart or blood vessel disease, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.
 For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.
 Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than are nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.
 If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.
 These foods contain antioxidant vitamins that reduce your risk of developing macular degeneration.
 Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.
"
Albinism,"Freckles.
Moles, with or without color, which are sometimes pink.
Large freckle-like spots, called solar lentigines (len-TIJ-ih-neez).
Sunburn and no ability to tan.
Rapid, back-and-forth movement of the eyes that can't be controlled, called nystagmus.
An uncommon head position or head posture, such as tilting the head to try to reduce eye movements and see better.
Eyes that can't look at the same direction at the same time or they appear to be crossed, a condition called strabismus.
Problems seeing near objects or far objects, called farsightedness or nearsightedness.
Extreme sensitivity to light, called photophobia.
A difference in the curve of the front surface of the eye or the lens inside the eye, called astigmatism, which causes blurred vision.
Differences in the development of the thin layer of tissue on the inside back wall of the eye, called the retina. This difference results in reduced vision.
Nerve signals from the retina to the brain that don't follow the usual nerve pathways in the eye. This is called misrouting of the optic nerve.
Poor depth perception, which means not being able to see things in three dimensions and judge how far away an object is.
Legal blindness â€” vision less than 20/200 â€” or complete blindness.
 the most common type, means a person gets two copies of a changed gene â€” one from each parent. This is called autosomal recessive inheritance. 
 is the result of a change in one of eight genes, labeled from

 causes decreased pigment in the skin, hair and eyes, as well as vision problems. The amount of pigment varies by type. The resulting color of skin, hair and eyes also varies by and within types.
 is mainly limited to the eyes, causing vision problems. The most common form of ocular albinism is type 1. This type is passed down by a gene change on the X chromosome. X-linked ocular albinism can be passed on by a mother who carries one changed X gene to her son. This is called X-linked recessive inheritance. Ocular albinism usually occurs only in males. It's much less common than

The need for brighter light when reading or doing close-up work.
Difficulty adjusting to low light levels, such as when entering a dimly lit restaurant or theater.
Increased blurriness of printed words.
Difficulty recognizing faces.
A well-defined blurry spot or blind spot in the field of vision.
You notice changes in your central vision.
You lose the ability to see fine detail.
 Sometimes irregular new blood vessels grow from the choroid under and into the macula. This is known as choroidal neovascularization. The choroid is the layer of blood vessels between the retina and the outer, firm coat of the eye, called the sclera. These blood vessels may leak fluid or blood, affecting the retina's function.
 When fluid leaks from the choroid, it can collect between the thin cell layer called the retinal pigment epithelium and the retina or within the layers of the retina. This may cause irregularities in the macula layers, resulting in vision loss or distortion.
 This disease is most common in people over 55.
 This disease has a genetic component. Researchers have identified several genes linked to the condition.
 Macular degeneration is more common in white people.
 Smoking cigarettes or being regularly exposed to tobacco smoke greatly increases your risk of macular degeneration.
 Research indicates that being obese increases the chance that early or intermediate macular degeneration will progress to a more severe form of the disease.
 If you have diseases that affect your heart and blood vessels, you may be at higher risk of macular degeneration.
 For example, if you have cardiovascular disease or high blood pressure, take your medicine and follow your health care provider's instructions for controlling the condition.
 Smokers are more likely to develop macular degeneration than nonsmokers. Ask your provider for help stopping smoking.
 If you need to lose weight, reduce the number of calories you eat and increase the amount of exercise you get each day.

 Omega-3 fatty acids, which are found in fish, may reduce the risk of macular degeneration. Nuts such as walnuts also contain omega-3 fatty acids.
"
Agoraphobia,"Leaving home alone.
Crowds or waiting in line.
Enclosed spaces, such as movie theaters, elevators or small stores.
Open spaces, such as parking lots, bridges or malls.

"
Myelofibrosis,"Feeling tired, weak or short of breath, usually because of anemia
Pain or fullness below your ribs on the left side, due to an enlarged spleen
Easy bruising
Easy bleeding
Excessive sweating during sleep (night sweats)
Fever
Bone pain
 Myelofibrosis can affect anyone, but it's most often diagnosed in people older than 50.
 A small portion of people with myelofibrosis develop the condition as a complication of essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera.
 Myelofibrosis has been linked to exposure to industrial chemicals such as toluene and benzene.
 People exposed to very high levels of radiation have an increased risk of myelofibrosis.
 Normally, blood flow from the spleen enters your liver through a large blood vessel called the portal vein. Increased blood flow from an enlarged spleen can lead to high blood pressure in the portal vein (portal hypertension). This in turn can force excess blood into smaller veins in your stomach and esophagus, potentially causing these veins to rupture and bleed.
 A severely enlarged spleen can cause abdominal pain and back pain.
 Formation of blood cells outside the bone marrow (extramedullary hematopoiesis) may create clumps (tumors) of developing blood cells in other areas of your body. These tumors may cause problems such as bleeding in your gastrointestinal system, coughing or spitting up of blood, compression of your spinal cord, or seizures.
 As the disease progresses, your platelet count tends to drop below normal (thrombocytopenia) and platelet function becomes impaired. An insufficient number of platelets can lead to easy bleeding â€” an issue that you and your doctor will want to discuss if you're contemplating any type of surgical procedure.
 Some people with myelofibrosis eventually develop acute myelogenous leukemia, a type of blood and bone marrow cancer that progresses rapidly.
"
Alcohol poisoning,"Confusion.
Vomiting.
Seizures.
Slow breathing, which is fewer than eight breaths a minute.
Breathing that's not regular. This is when there is a gap of more than 10 seconds between breaths.
Skin that looks blue, gray or pale.
Low body temperature, also known as hypothermia.
Trouble staying conscious or awake.
 or your local emergency number right away. Never assume the person will sleep off alcohol poisoning.
 If you know the kind and amount of alcohol the person drank, and when, tell hospital or emergency staff.
 Because alcohol poisoning affects the way the gag reflex works, someone with alcohol poisoning may vomit and choke and not be able to breathe. While waiting for help, don't try to make the person vomit because that could cause choking.
 Try to keep the person sitting up. If the person must lie down, turn the head to the side to help prevent choking. Try to keep the person awake.
Isopropyl alcohol, which is found in rubbing alcohol, lotions and some cleaning products.
Methanol or ethylene glycol, which is a common ingredient in antifreeze, paints and solvents.
 12 fluid ounces (360 milliliters) with about 5% alcohol.
 8 to 9 fluid ounces (240 to 270 milliliters) with about 7% alcohol.
 5 fluid ounces (150 milliliters) with about 12% alcohol.
 1.5 fluid ounces (45 milliliters) of an 80-proof drink, which has about 40% alcohol.
Your height and weight.
Health conditions that affect how your body processes alcohol.
Whether you've eaten recently.
Whether you've had alcohol along with other drugs, including medicines you take for health reasons.
The percentage of alcohol in your drinks.
How fast and how much alcohol you drink.
How your body processes alcohol.
 Alcohol may cause vomiting. Because it depresses the gag reflex, this increases the risk of choking on vomit if a person passes out.
 Accidentally inhaling vomit into the lungs can lead to a dangerous or fatal interruption of breathing, also known as asphyxiation.
 Vomiting can result in severe dehydration, which happens when the body doesn't have enough water and other fluids. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure and a fast heart rate.
 The blood sugar level may drop low enough to cause seizures.
 The body temperature may drop so low that it leads to cardiac arrest.
 Alcohol poisoning can cause a heartbeat that is not regular. It can even cause the heart to stop.
 Heavy drinking may cause brain damage that can't be reversed.
 Any of the issues above can lead to death.
 If you choose to drink alcohol, do so in moderation. For healthy adults, that means up to two drinks a day for males and one drink a day for females. When you drink, enjoy your drink slowly.
 Some medicines can cause harmful effects when taken with even small amounts of alcohol. And certain health conditions may mean it takes less alcohol than expected to reach the level of alcohol poisoning. Ask your health care provider if these risks apply to you.
 Having some food in your stomach may slow the process of absorbing alcohol somewhat. But it won't prevent alcohol poisoning during binge drinking.
 Talk to your teenagers about the dangers of alcohol, including binge drinking. Evidence suggests that children who are warned about alcohol by their parents and who report close relationships with their parents are less likely to start drinking.
 If you have small children, store alcohol-containing products, including cosmetics, mouthwashes and medicines, out of their reach. Use childproof bathroom and kitchen cabinets to prevent access to household cleaners. Keep toxic items in your garage or storage area safely out of reach. Consider keeping alcoholic beverages under lock and key.
 Ask about follow-up care for alcohol poisoning. Meeting with a health care provider, particularly an experienced chemical dependency counselor, can help prevent future binge drinking.
"
Adult Still disease," Fever may rise to at least 102 degrees Fahrenheit (38.9 degrees Celsius). The fever may spike once or twice a day for a week or longer. 
 A rash might come and go with the fever. The rash usually appears on the trunk, arms or legs.
 This is one of the first symptoms of adult Still disease. The lymph nodes in the neck might be swollen and tender.
 Joints â€” especially in the knees and wristsâ€” might be stiff, painful and inflamed. Ankles, elbows, hands and shoulders also might ache. The joint discomfort usually lasts at least two weeks.
 Muscular pain usually comes and goes with the fever. The pain can be severe enough to disrupt daily activities.
 The chronic swelling and irritation that occurs with adult Still disease can damage the joints. The most commonly involved joints are the knees and wrists. Sometimes other joints, including the neck, foot, finger and hip joints, also are affected.
 Adult Still disease can inflame the saclike covering of the heart, called the pericardium. This results in inflammation of the pericardium, called pericarditis. The disease can also inflame the muscular part of the heart, called the myocardium. This results in inflammation of the myocardium, called myocarditis.
 Inflammation may cause fluid to build up around the lungs. When this happens, it can be hard to take deep breaths.
 This is a rare but serious complication of adult Still disease. It happens when the immune system goes into overdrive and potentially harms organs such as the heart, liver, spleen and kidneys.

Childhood schizophrenia,"Problems with thinking and reasoning
Bizarre ideas or speech
Confusing dreams or television for reality
Withdrawal from friends and family
Trouble sleeping
Lack of motivation â€” for example, showing up as a drop in performance at school
Not meeting daily expectations, such as bathing or dressing
Bizarre behavior
Violent or aggressive behavior or agitation
Recreational drug or nicotine use
Irritability or depressed mood
Lack of emotion, or emotions inappropriate for the situation
Strange anxieties and fears
Excessive suspicion of others
 These are false beliefs that are not based in reality. For example, you think that you're being harmed or harassed; that certain gestures or comments are directed at you; that you have exceptional ability or fame; that another person is in love with you; or that a major catastrophe is about to occur. Delusions occur in most people with schizophrenia.
 These usually involve seeing or hearing things that don't exist. Yet for the person with schizophrenia, hallucinations have the full force and impact of a normal experience. Hallucinations can be in any of the senses, but hearing voices is the most common hallucination.
 Disorganized thinking is inferred from disorganized speech. Effective communication can be impaired, and answers to questions may be partially or completely unrelated. Rarely, speech may include putting together meaningless words that can't be understood, sometimes known as word salad.
 This may show in several ways, from childlike silliness to unpredictable agitation. Behavior is not focused on a goal, which makes it hard to do tasks. Behavior can include resistance to instructions, inappropriate or bizarre posture, a complete lack of response, or useless and excessive movement.
 This refers to reduced or lack of ability to function normally. For example, the person may neglect personal hygiene or appear to lack emotion â€” doesn't make eye contact, doesn't change facial expressions, speaks in a monotone, or doesn't add hand or head movements that normally occur when speaking. Also, the person may avoid people and activities or lack the ability to experience pleasure.
Less likely to have delusions
More likely to have visual hallucinations
Having a family history of schizophrenia
Increased immune system activation, such as from inflammation
Older age of the father
Some pregnancy and birth complications, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxins or viruses that may impact brain development
Taking mind-altering (psychoactive) drugs during teen years
Suicide, suicide attempts and thoughts of suicide
Self-injury
Anxiety disorders, panic disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD)
Depression
Abuse of alcohol or other drugs, including nicotine
Family conflicts
Inability to live independently, attend school or work
Social isolation
Health and medical problems
Being victimized
Legal and financial problems, and homelessness
Aggressive behavior, although uncommon

Yellow skin and eyes, called jaundice.
Pain in your upper belly or middle part of your back.
Nausea and vomiting.
Weakness or extreme tiredness.
Loss of appetite or feelings of fullness.
Weight loss for no known reason.
In type 1 
, the disease may affect other organs in addition to the pancreas. Type 2 
 affects only the pancreas. Type 2 disease also is associated with another autoimmune condition called inflammatory bowel disease.
Type 1 
 mostly affects men in the sixth to seventh decade of life.
Type 2 
 affects both men and women equally and has a younger age of onset compared with type 1 
.
Type 1 
 is more likely to relapse after treatment is discontinued.
Are over age 60.
Are male.
Are often one or two decades younger than those with type 1.
Are as likely to be female as male.
Are more likely to have inflammatory bowel disease, such as ulcerative colitis.
 
 may affect the ability of your pancreas to make enough enzymes. Symptoms may include diarrhea, weight loss, metabolic bone disease, and vitamin or mineral deficiency.
 Because the pancreas is the organ that produces insulin, damage to it may cause diabetes. You may need treatment with oral medicine or insulin.

Autoimmune hepatitis,"Fatigue
Abdominal discomfort
Yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice)
An enlarged liver
Abnormal blood vessels on the skin (spider angiomas)
Skin rashes
Joint pains
Loss of menstrual periods
 This is the most common type of the disease. It can occur at any age. About half the people with type 1 autoimmune hepatitis have other autoimmune disorders, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or ulcerative colitis.
 Although adults can develop type 2 autoimmune hepatitis, it's most common in children and young people. Other autoimmune diseases may accompany this type of autoimmune hepatitis.
 Although both males and females can develop autoimmune hepatitis, the disease is more common in females.
 Autoimmune hepatitis may develop after you're infected with the measles, herpes simplex or Epstein-Barr virus. The disease is also linked to hepatitis A, B or C infection.
 Evidence suggests that a predisposition to autoimmune hepatitis may run in families.
 People who already have an autoimmune disease, such as celiac disease, rheumatoid arthritis or hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis), may be more likely to develop autoimmune hepatitis.
 When circulation through the portal vein is blocked, blood may back up into other blood vessels â€” mainly those in your stomach and esophagus. The blood vessels are thin walled, and because they're filled with more blood than they're meant to carry, they're likely to bleed. Massive bleeding in the esophagus or stomach from these blood vessels is a life-threatening emergency that requires immediate medical care.
 Liver disease can cause large amounts of fluid to accumulate in your abdomen. Ascites can be uncomfortable and may interfere with breathing and is usually a sign of advanced cirrhosis.
 This occurs when extensive damage to liver cells makes it impossible for your liver to function adequately. At this point, a liver transplant is needed.
 People with cirrhosis have an increased risk of liver cancer.

 Several different genes appear to be involved in autism spectrum disorder. For some children, autism spectrum disorder can be associated with a genetic disorder, such as Rett syndrome or fragile X syndrome. For other children, genetic changes (mutations) may increase the risk of autism spectrum disorder. Still other genes may affect brain development or the way that brain cells communicate, or they may determine the severity of symptoms. Some genetic mutations seem to be inherited, while others occur spontaneously.
 Researchers are currently exploring whether factors such as viral infections, medications or complications during pregnancy, or air pollutants play a role in triggering autism spectrum disorder.
 Boys are about four times more likely to develop autism spectrum disorder than girls are.
 Families who have one child with autism spectrum disorder have an increased risk of having another child with the disorder. It's also not uncommon for parents or relatives of a child with autism spectrum disorder to have minor problems with social or communication skills themselves or to engage in certain behaviors typical of the disorder.
 Children with certain medical conditions have a higher than normal risk of autism spectrum disorder or autism-like symptoms. Examples include fragile X syndrome, an inherited disorder that causes intellectual problems; tuberous sclerosis, a condition in which benign tumors develop in the brain; and Rett syndrome, a genetic condition occurring almost exclusively in girls, which causes slowing of head growth, intellectual disability and loss of purposeful hand use.
 Babies born before 26 weeks of gestation may have a greater risk of autism spectrum disorder.
 There may be a connection between children born to older parents and autism spectrum disorder, but more research is necessary to establish this link.

"
Atypical hyperplasia of the breast," describes abnormal cells within the breast ducts.
 describes abnormal cells within the breast lobules.
 The process begins when normal cell development and growth become disrupted, causing an overproduction of normal-looking cells (hyperplasia).
 The excess cells stack upon one another and begin to take on an abnormal appearance.
 The abnormal cells continue to progress in appearance and multiply, evolving into in situ cancer, in which cancer cells remain confined to milk ducts.
 The abnormal cells accumulate within the duct and continue to multiply and transition to become cancer cells. Invasive cancer tends to invade surrounding tissue, blood vessels or lymph channels.
 about 7% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 7 can be expected to develop breast cancer five years after diagnosis. And 93 will not be diagnosed with breast cancer.
 about 13% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. That means for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 13 can be expetected to develop breast cancer 10 years after diagnosis. And 87 will not develop breast cancer.
 about 30% of women with atypical hyperplasia may develop breast cancer. Put another way, for every 100 women diagnosed with atypical hyperplasia, 30 can be expected to develop breast cancer 25 years after diagnosis. And 70 will not develop breast cancer.

Atopic dermatitis (eczema),"Dry, cracked skin
Itchiness (pruritus)
Rash on swollen skin that varies in color depending on your skin color
Small, raised bumps, on brown or Black skin
Oozing and crusting
Thickened skin
Darkening of the skin around the eyes
Raw, sensitive skin from scratching
Has symptoms of atopic dermatitis
Is so uncomfortable that the condition is affecting sleep and daily activities
Has a skin infection â€” look for new streaks, pus, yellow scabs
Has symptoms even after trying self-care steps
 Many people with atopic dermatitis develop asthma and hay fever. This can happen before or after developing atopic dermatitis.
 People with atopic dermatitis often develop food allergies. One of the main symptoms of this condition is hives (urticaria).
 A skin condition called neurodermatitis (lichen simplex chronicus) starts with a patch of itchy skin. You scratch the area, which provides only temporary relief. Scratching actually makes the skin itchier because it activates the nerve fibers in your skin. Over time, you may scratch out of habit. This condition can cause the affected skin to become discolored, thick and leathery.
 This complication after the rash has healed is called post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation or hypopigmentation. It's more common in people with brown or Black skin. It might take several months for the discoloration to fade.
 Repeated scratching that breaks the skin can cause open sores and cracks. These increase the risk of infection from bacteria and viruses. These skin infections can spread and become life-threatening.
 This especially affects people whose hands are often wet and exposed to harsh soaps, detergents and disinfectant at work.
 This condition is common in people with atopic dermatitis. Allergic contact dermatitis is an itchy rash caused by touching substances you're allergic to. The color of the rash varies depending on your skin color.
 The itchiness of atopic dermatitis can interfere with sleep.
 Atopic dermatitis is associated with depression and anxiety. This may be related to the constant itching and sleep problems common among people with atopic dermatitis.

    

    

    
 Use warm, rather than hot, water and limit your bath or shower to about 10 minutes.
 Choose a cleanser that's free of dyes, alcohols and fragrance. For young children, you usually need only warm water to get them clean â€” no soap or bubble bath needed. Soap can be especially irritating to the skin of young children. For people of any age, deodorant soaps and antibacterial soaps can remove too much of the skin's natural oils and dry the skin. Don't scrub the skin with a washcloth or loofah.
 After bathing, gently pat the skin with a soft towel. Apply moisturizer while your skin is still damp (within three minutes).

Athlete's foot,"Scaly, peeling or cracked skin between the toes
Itchiness, especially right after taking off shoes and socks
Inflamed skin that might appear reddish, purplish or grayish, depending on your skin color
Burning or stinging
Blisters
Dry, scaly skin on the bottom of the foot that extends up the side
Frequently wear enclosed footwear
Sweat heavily
Share mats, rugs, bed linens, clothes or shoes with someone who has a fungal infection
Walk barefoot in public areas where the infection can spread, such as locker rooms, saunas, swimming pools, communal baths and showers
 When you can, wear sandals to let your feet air out as much as possible.
 Use warm, soapy water and rinse and dry your feet thoroughly, especially between the toes. Apply a medicated foot powder (Tinactin, Gold Bond, others) or other medicated powder (Lotrimin AF, Zeasorb, others) if you're prone to athlete's foot.
 Change your socks at least once a day â€” more often if your feet get really sweaty. Moisture-wicking socks, such as those made from cotton, help keep your feet drier than do nylon socks.
 Use different shoes from day to day. This gives your shoes time to dry after each use.
 Wear waterproof sandals or shoes around public pools, showers and lockers rooms.
 If you live with others, don't share shoes or unwashed bedding and towels.

Knee bursitis,"Frequent and sustained pressure, such as from kneeling, especially on hard surfaces
Overuse or strenuous activity
A direct blow to your knee
Bacterial infection of the bursa
Complications from osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis or gout in your knee
 People who work on their knees for long periods â€” carpet layers, plumbers and gardeners â€” are at increased risk of knee bursitis.
 Sports that result in direct blows or frequent falls on the knee â€” such as wrestling, football and volleyball â€” can increase your risk of knee bursitis. Runners can develop pain and inflammation in the pes anserine bursa, situated on the inner side of your knee below the joint.
 Pes anserine bursitis, affecting the inner side of your knee below the joint, often occurs in obese women with osteoarthritis.
 If you're working on your knees or participating in sports that put your knees at risk, use padding to cushion and protect your knees.
 If you're on your knees for a period of time, take regular breaks to stretch your legs and rest your knees.
 Excessive or repetitious bending of your knees increases the force on your knee joints.
 This can help take pressure off your knee joint.

Hurt more when you move it or press on it
Look swollen and red
Disabling joint pain
Sudden inability to move a joint
Excessive swelling, redness, bruising or a rash in the affected area
Sharp or shooting pain, especially when you exercise or exert yourself
A fever
Throwing a baseball or lifting something over your head repeatedly
Leaning on your elbows for long periods
Extensive kneeling for tasks such as laying carpet or scrubbing floors
 Bursitis becomes more common with aging.
 If your work or hobby requires repetitive motion or pressure on particular bursae, your risk of developing bursitis increases. Examples include carpet laying, tile setting, gardening, painting and playing a musical instrument.
 Certain systemic diseases and conditions â€” such as rheumatoid arthritis, gout and diabetes â€” increase your risk of developing bursitis. Being overweight can increase your risk of developing hip and knee bursitis.
 Use some type of padding to reduce the pressure on your knees if your job or hobby requires a lot of kneeling.
 Bend your knees when you lift. Failing to do so puts extra stress on the bursae in your hips.
 Carrying heavy loads puts stress on the bursae in your shoulders. Use a dolly or a wheeled cart instead.
 Alternate repetitive tasks with rest or other activities.
 Being overweight places more stress on your joints.
 Strengthening your muscles can help protect your affected joint.

Poor balance
Difficulty with fine motor tasks, such as eating, writing or buttoning a shirt
Change in speech
Involuntary back-and-forth eye movements (nystagmus)
Difficulty swallowing
Lose balance
Lose muscle coordination in a hand, arm or leg
Have difficulty walking
Slur your speech
Have difficulty swallowing
 Long-term excess alcohol intake may cause persistent ataxia. It's possible it may improve by avoiding alcohol completely.
 Ataxia is a potential side effect of certain medications, especially barbiturates, such as phenobarbital; sedatives, such as benzodiazepines; antiepileptic drugs, such as phenytoin; and some types of chemotherapy.
 Heavy metal poisoning, such as from lead or mercury, and solvent poisoning, such as from paint thinner, also can cause ataxia.
 Not getting enough vitamin E, vitamin B-1, vitamin B-12 or thiamine can lead to ataxia. 
 Vitamin B-6 deficiency also may cause ataxia. These causes are important to identify because ataxia caused by these deficiencies can often be reversed.
 Hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism can cause ataxia.
 Sudden onset of ataxia occurs with a stroke. This may be either due to a blood vessel blockage or bleeding on the brain.
 This neurological disorder may cause ataxia.
 Sarcoidosis, celiac disease, certain types of encephalomyelitis and other autoimmune diseases may cause ataxia.
 Ataxia can be an uncommon complication of chickenpox in childhood, and other viral infections such as 
 and Lyme disease. It might appear in the healing stages of the infection and last for days or weeks. Normally, the symptoms get better over time.
 Ataxia most commonly results from severe 
 cases.
 These are rare degenerative disorders triggered by the immune system response to a cancerous tumor (neoplasm), most commonly from lung, ovarian or breast cancer or lymphoma. Ataxia can appear months or years before the cancer is diagnosed.
 An infected area (abscess) in the brain may cause ataxia. A growth on the brain, a cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign) tumor, can damage the cerebellum.
 Severe brain damage may cause cerebellar ataxia weeks to months after the trauma.
 This is a general term for a group of disorders caused by damage to a child's brain during early development â€” before, during or shortly after birth â€” that affects the child's ability to coordinate body movements.
 This affects adults around age 50. In addition to ataxia, other problems associated with this condition include bladder incontinence, low blood pressure or fainting on standing, and 
 sleep behavior disorder (yelling, kicking or punching in sleep).
 Researchers have identified more than 40 autosomal dominant ataxia genes, and the number continues to grow. Cerebellar ataxia and cerebellar degeneration are common to all types, and there may be other neurological signs and symptoms.
 There are eight recognized types of ataxia that are episodic rather than progressive â€” 
1 through 
7, plus late-onset episodic ataxia. 
1 and 
2 are the most common. 
1 involves brief ataxic episodes that may last seconds or minutes. The episodes are triggered by stress, being startled or sudden movement, and often are associated with muscle twitching. 
2 involves longer episodes, usually lasting from 30 minutes to six hours, which also are triggered by stress. There may be dizziness (vertigo), fatigue and muscle weakness during the episodes. In some cases, symptoms resolve in later life. Episodic ataxia doesn't shorten life span, and symptoms may respond to medication.

    

    

    

    
 This is the most common cause of late-onset ataxia. The ataxia symptoms are usually accompanied by dizziness, numbness or tingling in the body, and sometimes unexplained cough.

    

    

    

    
 This type of ataxia results from damage to the cerebellum that's present at birth.
 People with this condition accumulate copper in the brain, liver and other organs. This can cause ataxia and other neurological problems.
